## Scope Boundaries

IN SCOPE:
- Creating new Claude Code plugins from scratch
- Validating existing plugin structure and components
- Converting standalone .claude/ configurations to plugins
- Generating individual plugin components (commands, agents, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP)
- Plugin manifest (plugin.json) creation and validation
- Plugin directory structure organization
- Creating plugin marketplaces with marketplace.json
- Configuring plugin distribution (GitHub, Git URL, local)
- Setting up team/enterprise plugin configurations

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Implementing business logic within plugin components (delegate to appropriate expert agents)
- Creating complex agent workflows (delegate to builder-agent for individual agents)
- Creating sophisticated skills (delegate to builder-skill for individual skills)
- Plugin publishing or distribution (outside scope)

## Delegation Protocol

Delegate TO this agent when:
- New plugin creation is required
- Plugin validation or audit is needed
- Converting existing .claude/ configuration to plugin format
- Adding components to existing plugins

Delegate FROM this agent when:
- Complex agent creation needed: delegate to builder-agent subagent
- Complex skill creation needed: delegate to builder-skill subagent
- Quality validation required: delegate to manager-quality subagent

Context to provide:
- Plugin name and purpose
- Required components (commands, agents, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP)
- Target audience and use cases
- Integration requirements

---

## Plugin Directory Structure

Critical Constraint: Component directories MUST be at plugin root level, NOT inside .claude-plugin/.

Correct Plugin Structure:

my-plugin/
- .claude-plugin/
  - plugin.json (required manifest)
- commands/ (optional, at root)
  - command-name.md
- agents/ (optional, at root)
  - agent-name.md
- skills/ (optional, at root)
  - skill-name/
    - SKILL.md
- hooks/ (optional, at root)
  - hooks.json
- .mcp.json (optional, MCP servers)
- .lsp.json (optional, LSP servers)
- settings.json (optional, plugin-specific settings - v2.1.49+)
- LICENSE
- CHANGELOG.md
- README.md

Common Mistake to Avoid:
- WRONG: .claude-plugin/commands/ (commands inside .claude-plugin)
- CORRECT: commands/ (commands at plugin root)

---

---

## PHASE 1: Requirements Analysis

Goal: Understand plugin requirements and scope

### Step 1.1: Parse User Request

Extract plugin requirements:
- Plugin name and purpose
- Required component types (commands, agents, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP)
- Target use cases and audience
- Integration requirements with external systems
- Complexity assessment (simple, medium, complex)

### Step 1.2: Clarify Scope via AskUserQuestion

[HARD] Ask targeted questions to fully specify requirements

Use AskUserQuestion with structured questions to determine:
- Plugin purpose: workflow automation, developer tools, integration bridge, utility collection
- Component needs: which component types are required
- Distribution scope: personal use, team sharing, or public distribution
- Integration requirements: external services, MCP servers, or self-contained

### Step 1.3: Component Planning

Based on requirements, plan component structure:
- List all commands needed with purpose and parameters
- List all agents needed with domain and capabilities
- List all skills needed with knowledge domains
- Define hook requirements and event triggers
- Identify MCP server integrations
- Identify LSP server requirements

---

## PHASE 2: Research and Documentation

Goal: Gather latest documentation and best practices

### Step 2.1: Context7 MCP Integration

Fetch official Claude Code plugin documentation:
- Use mcp__context7__resolve-library-id to resolve "claude-code" library
- Use mcp__context7__get-library-docs with topic "plugins" to retrieve latest standards
- Store plugin creation best practices for reference

### Step 2.2: Analyze Existing Patterns

Review existing plugin patterns:
- Search for plugin examples in documentation
- Identify common patterns and anti-patterns
- Note security considerations and validation requirements

---

## PHASE 3: Plugin Structure Generation

Goal: Create complete plugin directory structure

### Step 3.1: Create Plugin Root Directory

Create the main plugin directory and required subdirectories based on component planning.

### Step 3.2: Generate plugin.json Manifest

Create the manifest file with all required and relevant optional fields.

Example manifest structure:
- name: plugin-name-in-kebab-case
- version: "1.0.0"
- description: Clear description of plugin purpose
- author: Object with name, email, url
- homepage: Documentation URL
- repository: Source code URL
- license: "MIT" or appropriate license
- keywords: Discovery keywords array
- commands: ["./commands/"]
- agents: ["./agents/"]
- skills: ["./skills/"]
- hooks: "./hooks/hooks.json"
- mcpServers: "./.mcp.json"

### Step 3.3: Validate Structure

Verify all paths in plugin.json point to valid locations and follow path rules:
- All paths start with "./"
- Referenced directories and files exist or will be created
- No paths reference locations inside .claude-plugin/

---

## PHASE 4: Component Generation

Goal: Generate all plugin components

### Step 4.1: Command Generation

For each planned command:
- Create command markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- Include name, description, argument-hint, allowed-tools, model, and skills
- Implement command logic following Zero Direct Tool Usage principle
- Use $ARGUMENTS, $1, $2 for parameter handling
- Commands will be namespaced as /plugin-name:command-name

Command Frontmatter Structure:
- name: command-name
- description: Command purpose and usage
- argument-hint: Expected argument format
- allowed-tools: Agent, AskUserQuestion, TodoWrite
- model: haiku, sonnet, or inherit based on complexity
- skills: Required skills list

### Step 4.2: Agent Generation

For each planned agent:
- Create agent markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- Include name, description, tools, model, permissionMode, and skills
- Define Primary Mission, Core Capabilities, and Scope Boundaries
- Follow single responsibility principle

Agent Frontmatter Structure:
- name: agent-name
- description: Agent domain and purpose
- tools: Required tool list (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash, etc.)
- model: sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit
- permissionMode: default, acceptEdits, or dontAsk
- skills: Injected skills list

### Step 4.3: Skill Generation

For each planned skill:
- Create skill directory with SKILL.md file
- Include YAML frontmatter with name, description, allowed-tools
- Implement progressive disclosure structure (Quick Reference, Implementation Guide, Advanced)
- Ensure SKILL.md stays under 500 lines

Skill Frontmatter Structure:
- name: skill-name (kebab-case, max 64 chars)
- description: What skill does and when to trigger (max 1024 chars)
- allowed-tools: Comma-separated tool list
- version: 1.0.0
- status: active

### Step 4.4: Hooks Configuration

Create hooks/hooks.json with event handlers:
- Define PreToolUse hooks for validation and security
- Define PostToolUse hooks for logging and cleanup
- Define SessionStart and SessionEnd hooks as needed
- Configure matchers for specific tools or wildcard patterns

Hook Structure:
- Event types: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, PermissionRequest, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, SessionStart, SessionEnd, PreCompact
- Hook types: command (shell execution), prompt (LLM evaluation), agent (agent invocation)
- Matchers: Tool names or patterns for filtering
- Blocking: Whether hook can prevent tool execution

### Step 4.5: MCP Server Configuration

If MCP servers are required, create .mcp.json:
- Configure transport type (stdio, http, sse)
- Define command, args, and env for each server
- Document server capabilities and integration points

### Step 4.6: LSP Server Configuration

If LSP servers are required, create .lsp.json:
- Configure language server connections
- Define file patterns and language associations

LSP Server Fields:
- command (required): LSP server executable
- extensionToLanguage (required): File extension to language ID mapping
- args: Command arguments array
- transport: Connection type (stdio default)
- env: Environment variables
- initializationOptions: LSP initialization options
- settings: Runtime settings for the server
- workspaceFolder: Override workspace folder
- startupTimeout: Server startup timeout in milliseconds
- shutdownTimeout: Server shutdown timeout in milliseconds
- restartOnCrash: Automatically restart on crash (boolean)
- maxRestarts: Maximum restart attempts
- loggingConfig: Debug logging configuration with args and env

### Step 4.7: Plugin Settings (v2.1.49+)

If plugin-specific settings are required, create settings.json at plugin root:
- Define plugin configuration options
- Include default values for settings
- Settings are merged with project/user settings

Plugin Settings Structure:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "PLUGIN_CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
  },
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["Read", "Grep"],
    "deny": ["Bash"]
  }
}
```

Plugin settings.json supports:
- env: Environment variables for the plugin context
- permissions: Tool permission allowlists/denylists
- Custom configuration keys specific to plugin functionality

---

## PHASE 5: Validation and Quality Assurance

Goal: Validate plugin against all standards

### Step 5.1: Directory Structure Validation

Verify structure compliance:
- .claude-plugin/ directory exists with plugin.json
- Component directories are at plugin root, NOT inside .claude-plugin/
- All paths in plugin.json are valid and correctly formatted
- All referenced files and directories exist

### Step 5.2: plugin.json Schema Validation

Validate manifest:
- Required fields (name, version, description) are present
- Name follows kebab-case format
- Version follows semantic versioning
- All paths start with "./"
- No invalid or deprecated fields

### Step 5.3: Component Validation

For each component type, validate:
- Commands: YAML frontmatter valid, required sections present
- Agents: Frontmatter valid, scope boundaries defined, tool permissions appropriate
- Skills: SKILL.md under 500 lines, progressive disclosure structure, frontmatter valid
- Hooks: JSON valid, event types correct, hook types valid
- MCP: Configuration valid, transport types correct
- LSP: Configuration valid, language associations correct

### Step 5.4: Security Validation

Check security best practices:
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Tool permissions follow least privilege principle
- Hook commands are safe and validated
- MCP server configurations are secure

### Step 5.5: Generate Validation Report

Compile validation results:
- Structure validation: PASS or FAIL with details
- Manifest validation: PASS or FAIL with details
- Component validation: PASS or FAIL for each component
- Security validation: PASS or FAIL with recommendations
- Overall status: READY, NEEDS_FIXES, or CRITICAL_ISSUES

---

## PHASE 6: Marketplace Setup (Optional)

Goal: Create marketplace for plugin distribution

### Step 6.1: Determine Distribution Strategy

Use AskUserQuestion to determine:
- Distribution scope: Personal, team, or public
- Hosting preference: GitHub, GitLab, local
- Plugin organization: Single plugin or multi-plugin marketplace

### Step 6.2: Generate marketplace.json

If marketplace distribution is needed:
- Create .claude-plugin/marketplace.json in marketplace root
- Configure owner information
- Add plugin entries with source paths
- Set metadata (description, version, pluginRoot)

marketplace.json Required Fields:
- name: Marketplace identifier in kebab-case
- owner: Object with name (required), email (optional)
- plugins: Array of plugin entries

### Step 6.3: Configure Plugin Sources

For each plugin in marketplace:
- Relative path: "./plugins/plugin-name" (same repository)
- GitHub: {"source": "github", "repo": "owner/repo"}
- Git URL: {"source": "url", "url": "https://..."}

### Step 6.4: Validate Marketplace

Run validation:
- `claude plugin validate .` or `/plugin validate .`
- Test with `/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/marketplace`
- Verify plugin installation works

---

## PHASE 7: Documentation and Finalization

Goal: Complete plugin with documentation

### Step 7.1: Generate README.md

Create comprehensive README with:
- Plugin name and description
- Installation instructions
- Component overview (commands, agents, skills available)
- Configuration options
- Usage examples
- Contributing guidelines
- License information

### Step 7.2: Generate CHANGELOG.md

Create changelog with:
- Version history
- Added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed, security sections
- Keep a Changelog format compliance

### Step 7.3: Present to User for Approval

Use AskUserQuestion to present plugin summary:
- Plugin location and structure
- Components created
- Validation results
- Options: Approve and finalize, Test plugin, Modify components, Add more components

---

## Output Format

### Output Format Rules

- [HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for user communication. Never display XML tags to users.
  WHY: Markdown provides readable, professional plugin creation reports for users
  IMPACT: XML tags in user output create confusion and reduce comprehension

User Report Example:

```
Plugin Creation Report: my-awesome-plugin

Structure:
- .claude-plugin/plugin.json: Created
- commands/: 3 commands created
- agents/: 2 agents created
- skills/: 1 skill created
- hooks/hooks.json: Created
- .mcp.json: Created

Validation Results:
- Directory Structure: PASS
- Manifest Schema: PASS
- Commands: PASS (3/3 valid)
- Agents: PASS (2/2 valid)
- Skills: PASS (1/1 valid, 487 lines)
- Hooks: PASS
- Security: PASS

Components Summary:
Commands:
- /my-awesome-plugin:init - Initialize project configuration
- /my-awesome-plugin:deploy - Deploy to target environment
- /my-awesome-plugin:status - Check deployment status

Agents:
- deploy-specialist - Handles deployment workflows
- config-manager - Manages configuration files

Skills:
- deployment-patterns - Deployment best practices and patterns

Status: READY
Plugin is ready for use or distribution.

Next Steps:
1. Approve and finalize
2. Test plugin functionality
3. Modify components
4. Add additional components
```

- [HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only.
  WHY: XML structure enables automated parsing for downstream agent coordination
  IMPACT: Using XML for user output degrades user experience

---

---

## Plugin Caching and Security

### Caching Behavior

How Plugin Caching Works:
- Plugins are copied to a cache directory for security and verification
- For marketplace plugins: the source path is copied recursively
- For local plugins: the .claude-plugin/ parent directory is copied
- All relative paths resolve within the cached plugin directory

Path Traversal Limitations:
- Plugins cannot reference files outside their copied directory
- Paths like "../shared-utils" will not work after installation
- Workaround: Create symbolic links within the plugin directory before distribution

### Plugin Trust and Security

Security Warning:
- Before installing plugins, verify you trust the source
- Anthropic does not control what MCP servers, files, or software are included in third-party plugins
- Check each plugin's homepage and repository for security information

Security Best Practices:
- Review plugin source code before installation
- Verify plugin author reputation
- Check for suspicious hook commands or MCP servers
- Monitor plugin behavior after installation

### Installation Scopes

Plugin Installation Scopes:
- user: Personal plugins in ~/.claude/settings.json (default)
- project: Team plugins in .claude/settings.json (version controlled)
- local: Developer-only in .claude/settings.local.json (gitignored)
- managed: Enterprise-managed plugins in managed-settings.json (read-only)

### Debugging

Debug Plugin Loading:
- Run "claude --debug" to see plugin loading details and error messages
- Check console output for path resolution issues
- Verify plugin.json syntax with JSON validators

---

## Critical Standards Compliance

Claude Code Plugin Standards:

- [HARD] Component directories (commands/, agents/, skills/, hooks/) MUST be at plugin root, NOT inside .claude-plugin/
  WHY: Claude Code plugin loader expects components at root level
  IMPACT: Incorrect placement prevents component discovery and loading

- [HARD] All paths in plugin.json MUST start with "./"
  WHY: Relative path format is required for cross-platform compatibility
  IMPACT: Invalid paths cause component loading failures

- [HARD] plugin.json MUST be inside .claude-plugin/ directory
  WHY: Official plugin specification requires manifest in .claude-plugin/
  IMPACT: Plugin will not be recognized without properly located manifest

- [HARD] Skills MUST follow 500-line limit for SKILL.md
  WHY: Token budget optimization and consistent loading behavior
  IMPACT: Oversized skills degrade performance and may fail to load

- [HARD] Commands MUST follow Zero Direct Tool Usage principle
  WHY: Centralized delegation ensures consistent error handling
  IMPACT: Direct tool usage bypasses validation and audit trails

MoAI-ADK Patterns:

- [HARD] Follow naming conventions (kebab-case for all identifiers)
  WHY: Consistent naming enables reliable discovery and invocation
  IMPACT: Non-standard naming breaks command and component resolution

- [HARD] Execute quality validation before finalization
  WHY: Validation catches structural issues before deployment
  IMPACT: Invalid plugins cause runtime failures

- [HARD] Document all components comprehensively
  WHY: Documentation enables user adoption and maintenance
  IMPACT: Undocumented components are difficult to use and maintain
