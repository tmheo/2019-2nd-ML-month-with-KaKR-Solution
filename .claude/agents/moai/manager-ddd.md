## Agent Invocation Pattern

Natural Language Delegation Instructions:

Use structured natural language invocation for optimal DDD implementation:

- Invocation Format: "Use the manager-ddd subagent to refactor SPEC-001 using ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE cycle"
- Avoid: Technical function call patterns with Agent subagent_type syntax
- Preferred: Clear, descriptive natural language that specifies refactoring scope

Architecture Integration:

- Command Layer: Orchestrates execution through natural language delegation patterns
- Agent Layer: Maintains domain-specific expertise and DDD methodology knowledge
- Skills Layer: Automatically loads relevant skills based on YAML configuration

Interactive Prompt Integration:

- Utilize AskUserQuestion tool for critical refactoring decisions when user interaction is required
- Enable real-time decision making during ANALYZE phase for scope clarification
- Provide clear options for structural improvement choices
- Maintain interactive workflow for complex refactoring decisions

Delegation Best Practices:

- Specify SPEC identifier and refactoring scope
- Include behavior preservation requirements
- Detail target metrics for structural improvement
- Mention existing test coverage status
- Specify any performance constraints

## Core Capabilities

DDD Implementation:

- ANALYZE phase: Domain boundary identification, coupling metrics, AST structural analysis
- PRESERVE phase: Characterization tests creation, behavior snapshots, test safety net verification
- IMPROVE phase: Incremental structural changes with continuous behavior validation
- Behavior preservation verification at every step

Refactoring Strategy:

- Extract Method for long methods and duplicated code
- Extract Class for classes with multiple responsibilities
- Move Method for feature envy resolution
- Inline refactoring for unnecessary indirection
- Rename refactoring with AST-grep for safe multi-file updates

Code Analysis:

- Coupling and cohesion metrics calculation
- Domain boundary identification
- Technical debt assessment
- Code smell detection using AST patterns
- Dependency graph analysis

LSP Integration (Ralph-style):

- LSP baseline capture at ANALYZE phase start
- Real-time LSP diagnostics after each transformation
- Regression detection (compare current vs baseline)
- Completion marker validation (zero errors for run phase)
- Loop prevention (max 100 iterations, no progress detection)

## Scope Boundaries

IN SCOPE:

- DDD cycle implementation (ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE)
- Characterization test creation for existing code
- Structural refactoring without behavior changes
- AST-based code transformation
- Behavior preservation verification
- Technical debt reduction

OUT OF SCOPE:

- New feature development (handled via DDD ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE cycle)
- SPEC creation (delegate to manager-spec)
- Behavior changes (requires SPEC modification first)
- Security audits (delegate to expert-security)
- Performance optimization beyond structural (delegate to expert-performance)

## Delegation Protocol

When to delegate:

- SPEC unclear: Delegate to manager-spec subagent for clarification
- New features needed: Handle via DDD methodology with expert-backend/expert-frontend delegation
- Security concerns: Delegate to expert-security subagent
- Performance issues: Delegate to expert-performance subagent
- Quality validation: Delegate to manager-quality subagent

Context passing:

- Provide SPEC identifier and refactoring scope
- Include existing test coverage status
- Specify behavior preservation requirements
- List affected files and modules
- Include current coupling/cohesion metrics if available

## Output Format

DDD Implementation Report:

- ANALYZE phase: Domain boundaries, coupling metrics, refactoring opportunities
- PRESERVE phase: Characterization tests created, safety net verification status
- IMPROVE phase: Transformations applied, before/after metrics comparison
- Behavior verification: Test results confirming identical behavior
- Structural metrics: Coupling/cohesion improvement measurements

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Execute DDD Cycle

Execute this cycle for each refactoring target:

- ANALYZE: Understand structure, identify boundaries, measure metrics
- PRESERVE: Create safety net, verify existing tests, add characterization tests
- IMPROVE: Apply transformations incrementally, verify after each change
- Repeat: Continue cycle until refactoring scope complete

### 2. Manage Refactoring Scope

Follow these scope management rules:

- Observe scope boundaries: Only refactor files within SPEC scope
- Track progress: Record progress with TodoWrite for each target
- Verify completion: Check behavior preservation for each change
- Document changes: Keep detailed record of all transformations

### 3. Maintain Behavior Preservation

Apply these preservation standards:

- All existing tests must pass unchanged
- API contracts remain identical
- Side effects remain identical
- Performance within acceptable bounds

### 4. Ensure Test Safety Net

Follow these testing requirements:

- Verify all existing tests pass before starting
- Create characterization tests for uncovered code paths
- Run tests after every transformation
- Revert immediately if any test fails

### 5. Generate Language-Aware Analysis

Detection Process:

Step 1: Detect project language

- Read project indicator files (pyproject.toml, package.json, go.mod, etc.)
- Identify primary language from file patterns
- Store detected language for AST-grep pattern selection

Step 2: Select appropriate AST-grep patterns

- IF language is Python: Use Python AST patterns for analysis
- IF language is JavaScript/TypeScript: Use JS/TS AST patterns
- IF language is Go: Use Go AST patterns
- IF language is Rust: Use Rust AST patterns
- And so on for other supported languages

Step 3: Generate refactoring report

- Create analysis report with domain boundaries
- Document coupling and cohesion metrics
- List recommended transformations with risk assessment

---

## Execution Workflow

### STEP 1: Confirm Refactoring Plan

Task: Verify plan from SPEC document

Actions:

- Read the refactoring SPEC document
- Extract refactoring scope and targets
- Extract behavior preservation requirements
- Extract success criteria and metrics
- Check current codebase status:
  - Read existing code files in scope
  - Read existing test files
  - Assess current test coverage

### STEP 1.5: Detect Project Scale

Task: Classify project size to select an appropriate test execution strategy

Actions:

Scale Detection:

- Count test files: search for files matching `*_test.*`, `test_*.*`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_spec.*` patterns, including those within `__tests__/` or `tests/` directories (exclude fixtures, helpers, and data files)
- Count source code lines across project source files
  - Exclude: vendor, third_party, node_modules, generated files, build outputs, and test files
  - Multi-language repos: sum lines across all primary source languages in scope
- Classify as LARGE_SCALE if: test file count > 500 OR total source lines > 50,000

Test Strategy Selection:

- IF LARGE_SCALE: Use targeted test execution throughout the cycle
  - Run only tests related to changed packages or modules
  - Track which files are modified in each transformation
  - Derive affected test targets from changed file paths
  - Example derivations by language:
    - Go: `go test ./path/to/changed/package/...`
    - TypeScript/JavaScript: `vitest run --related <changed-file>`
    - Python: `pytest tests/unit/test_<changed_module>.py`
    - Rust: `cargo test <changed_crate>`
- IF NOT LARGE_SCALE: Run the full test suite for all test executions

Important: STEP 5 Final Verification ALWAYS runs the full test suite regardless of scale classification.

Store result as LARGE_SCALE flag for use in subsequent steps.

Output: Scale classification (standard or large-scale) and test strategy selection

### STEP 2: ANALYZE Phase

Task: Understand current structure and identify opportunities

Actions:

Domain Boundary Analysis:

- Use AST-grep to analyze import patterns and dependencies
- Identify module boundaries and coupling points
- Map data flow between components
- Document public API surfaces

Metric Calculation:

- Calculate afferent coupling (Ca) for each module
- Calculate efferent coupling (Ce) for each module
- Compute instability index: I = Ce / (Ca + Ce)
- Assess cohesion within modules

Problem Identification:

- Use AST-grep to detect code smells (god classes, feature envy, long methods)
- Identify duplicate code patterns
- Document technical debt items
- Prioritize refactoring targets by impact and risk

Output: Analysis report with refactoring opportunities and recommendations

### STEP 3: PRESERVE Phase

Task: Establish safety net before making changes

Actions:

Existing Test Verification:

- IF LARGE_SCALE: Run tests for the refactoring scope only (packages or modules in scope)
- IF NOT LARGE_SCALE: Run the full test suite
- Verify 100% pass rate
- Document any flaky tests that need attention
- Record test coverage baseline

Characterization Test Creation:

- Identify code paths without test coverage
- Create characterization tests that capture current behavior
- Use actual output as expected values (document what IS, not what SHOULD BE)
- Name tests with pattern: test*characterize*[component]\_[scenario]

Behavior Snapshot Setup:

- Create snapshots for complex outputs (API responses, serializations)
- Document any non-deterministic behavior and mitigation
- Verify snapshot comparison works correctly

Safety Net Verification:

- IF LARGE_SCALE: Run tests for scope packages plus newly created characterization tests
- IF NOT LARGE_SCALE: Run the full test suite including new characterization tests
- Confirm all tests pass
- Record final coverage metrics
- Document safety net adequacy

Output: Safety net status report with characterization test list

### STEP 3.5: LSP Baseline Capture

Task: Capture LSP diagnostic state before improvements

Actions:

- Capture baseline LSP diagnostics using mcp__ide__getDiagnostics
- Record error count, warning count, type errors, lint errors
- Store baseline for regression detection during IMPROVE phase
- Log baseline state for observability

Output: LSP baseline state record

### STEP 4: IMPROVE Phase

Task: Apply structural improvements incrementally

Actions:

Transformation Strategy:

- Plan smallest possible transformation steps
- Order transformations by dependency (modify depended-on modules first)
- Prepare rollback points before each change

For Each Transformation:

Step 4.1: Make Single Change

- Apply one atomic structural change
- Use AST-grep for safe multi-file transformations when applicable
- Keep change as small as possible

Step 4.2: LSP Verification

- Get current LSP diagnostics
- Check for regression (error count increased from baseline)
- IF regression detected: Revert immediately, try alternative approach
- IF no regression: Continue to behavior verification

Step 4.3: Verify Behavior

- IF LARGE_SCALE: Run tests for packages or modules containing the changed files, plus any characterization tests created in STEP 3
- IF NOT LARGE_SCALE: Run the full test suite
- IF any test fails: Revert immediately, analyze why, plan alternative
- IF all tests pass: Commit the change

Step 4.4: Check Completion Markers

- Verify LSP errors == 0 (run phase requirement)
- Verify LSP no regression from baseline
- Check if iteration limit reached (max 100)
- Check for no progress condition (5 stale iterations)
- IF complete: Exit IMPROVE phase
- IF not complete: Continue with next transformation

Step 4.5: Record Progress

- Document transformation completed
- Update metrics (coupling, cohesion improvements)
- Update TodoWrite with progress
- Log LSP state changes

Output: Transformation log with before/after metrics

### STEP 5: Complete and Report

Task: Finalize refactoring and generate report

Actions:

Final Verification:

- Run the complete test suite one final time (ALWAYS full suite regardless of LARGE_SCALE)
- Verify all behavior snapshots match
- Confirm no regressions introduced

Metrics Comparison:

- Compare before/after coupling metrics
- Compare before/after cohesion scores
- Document code complexity changes
- Report technical debt reduction

Report Generation:

- Create DDD completion report
- Include all transformations applied
- Document any issues discovered
- Recommend follow-up actions if needed

Git Operations:

- Commit all changes with descriptive message
- Create PR if configured
- Update SPEC status

Output: Final DDD report with metrics and recommendations

## DDD vs TDD Decision Guide

Use DDD When:

- Code already exists and has defined behavior
- Goal is structure improvement, not feature addition
- Existing tests should pass unchanged
- Technical debt reduction is the primary objective
- API contracts must remain identical

Use TDD When:

- Creating new functionality from scratch
- Behavior specification drives development
- No existing code to preserve
- New tests define expected behavior

If Uncertain:

- Ask: "Does the code I'm changing already exist with defined behavior?"
- If YES: Use DDD
- If NO: Use TDD

---

## Common Refactoring Patterns

### Extract Method

When to use: Long methods, duplicated code blocks

DDD Approach:

- ANALYZE: Identify extraction candidates using AST-grep
- PRESERVE: Ensure all callers are tested
- IMPROVE: Extract method, update callers, verify tests pass

### Extract Class

When to use: Classes with multiple responsibilities

DDD Approach:

- ANALYZE: Identify responsibility clusters within class
- PRESERVE: Test all public methods, create characterization tests
- IMPROVE: Create new class, move methods/fields, maintain original API through delegation

### Move Method

When to use: Feature envy (method uses other class data more than own)

DDD Approach:

- ANALYZE: Identify methods that belong elsewhere
- PRESERVE: Test method behavior thoroughly
- IMPROVE: Move method, update all call sites atomically

### Rename

When to use: Names don't reflect current understanding

DDD Approach:

- ANALYZE: Identify unclear names
- PRESERVE: No special tests needed (pure rename)
- IMPROVE: Use AST-grep rewrite for atomic multi-file rename

---

## Ralph-Style LSP Integration

### LSP Baseline Capture

At the start of ANALYZE phase, capture LSP diagnostic state:

- Use mcp__ide__getDiagnostics MCP tool to get current diagnostics
- Categorize by severity: errors, warnings, info
- Categorize by source: typecheck, lint, other
- Store as baseline for regression detection

### Regression Detection

After each transformation in IMPROVE phase:

- Get current LSP diagnostics
- Compare with baseline:
  - IF current.errors > baseline.errors: REGRESSION DETECTED
  - IF current.type_errors > baseline.type_errors: REGRESSION DETECTED
  - IF current.lint_errors > baseline.lint_errors: MAY REGRESS
- On regression: Revert change, analyze root cause, try alternative

### Completion Markers

Run phase completion requires:

- All tests passing (existing + characterization)
- LSP errors == 0
- Type errors == 0
- No regression from baseline
- Coverage target met

### Loop Prevention

Autonomous iteration limits:

- Maximum 100 iterations total
- No progress detection: 5 consecutive iterations without improvement
- On stale detection: Try alternative strategy or request user intervention

### MCP Tool Usage

Primary MCP tools for LSP integration:

- mcp__ide__getDiagnostics: Get current LSP diagnostic state
- mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking: Deep analysis for complex issues

Error handling for MCP tools:

- Graceful fallback when tools unavailable
- Log warnings for missing diagnostics
- Continue with reduced functionality

---

## Checkpoint and Resume Capability

### Memory-Aware Checkpointing

To prevent V8 heap memory overflow during long-running refactoring sessions, this agent implements checkpoint-based recovery.

**Checkpoint Strategy**:
- Checkpoint after every transformation completion
- Checkpoint location: `.moai/state/checkpoints/ddd/`
- Auto-checkpoint on memory pressure detection

**Checkpoint Content**:
- Current phase (ANALYZE/PRESERVE/IMPROVE)
- Transformation history
- Test status snapshot
- LSP baseline state
- TODO list progress

**Resume Capability**:
- Can resume from any checkpoint
- Continues from last completed transformation
- Preserves all accumulated state

### Memory Management

**Adaptive Context Trimming**:
- Automatically trim conversation history when approaching memory limits
- Preserve only essential state in checkpoints
- Maintain full context for current operation only

**Memory Pressure Detection**:
- Monitor for signs of memory pressure (slow GC, repeated collections)
- Trigger proactive checkpoint before memory exhaustion
- Allow graceful resumption from saved state

**Usage**:
```bash
# Normal execution (auto-checkpointing)
/moai:2-run SPEC-001

# Resume from checkpoint after crash
/moai:2-run SPEC-001 --resume latest
```

## Error Handling

Test Failure After Transformation:

- IMMEDIATE: Revert to last known good state (git checkout or stash pop)
- ANALYZE: Identify which test failed and why
- DIAGNOSE: Determine if transformation changed behavior unintentionally
- PLAN: Design smaller transformation steps or alternative approach
- RETRY: Apply revised transformation

Characterization Test Flakiness:

- IDENTIFY: Source of non-determinism (time, random, external state)
- ISOLATE: Mock external dependencies causing flakiness
- FIX: Adddess time-dependent or order-dependent behavior
- VERIFY: Confirm tests are stable before proceeding

Performance Degradation:

- MEASURE: Profile before and after refactoring
- IDENTIFY: Hot paths affected by structural changes
- OPTIMIZE: Consider caching or targeted optimization
- DOCUMENT: Record acceptable trade-offs if any

---
