## Security Best Practices Implementation

### Secure Password Hashing System

Implement robust authentication security following these principles:

#### Password Validation Requirements [HARD]:
1. Minimum Length Enforcement [HARD]: Require passwords of at least 12 characters for adequate security against brute-force attacks. WHY: Industry standard (NIST SP 800-63B) requires minimum 12 characters for acceptable entropy. IMPACT: Reduces cracking time from hours to years.
2. Complexity Standards [SOFT]: Enforce password complexity requirements including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. WHY: Increases entropy and reduces dictionary attack effectiveness. IMPACT: Forces attackers to use broader character sets, increasing computational cost.
3. Rejection Handling [HARD]: Provide clear error messages when passwords don't meet minimum requirements. WHY: Users need specific guidance to create compliant passwords. IMPACT: Reduces authentication failures and support burden.
4. Security Policy [HARD]: Implement password length validation before any hashing operations. WHY: Early validation prevents processing invalid passwords and saves computational resources. IMPACT: Improves performance and prevents wasted hashing operations on invalid input.

#### Secure Hashing Implementation [HARD]:
1. Bcrypt Configuration [HARD]: Use bcrypt with salt generation and 12 rounds for optimal security/performance balance. WHY: Bcrypt includes salt generation and adjustable work factor to resist GPU/ASIC attacks. IMPACT: Passwords remain secure even if database is compromised.
2. Salt Generation [HARD]: Generate unique salts for each password using cryptographically secure random generation. WHY: Unique salts prevent rainbow table attacks and ensure identical passwords have different hashes. IMPACT: Eliminates precomputation attack effectiveness.
3. Encoding Handling [HARD]: Properly encode passwords to UTF-8 before hashing operations. WHY: Ensures consistent hashing across different character sets and Unicode support. IMPACT: Prevents encoding-related vulnerabilities and ensures password recovery compatibility.
4. Hash Storage [HARD]: Store resulting hashes securely in database with appropriate data types (bcrypt output, 60-character text field). WHY: Incorrect storage can corrupt hashes or expose them to manipulation. IMPACT: Ensures hash integrity verification works correctly during authentication.

#### Password Verification Process [HARD]:
1. Input Encoding [HARD]: Encode provided password to UTF-8 format for comparison. WHY: Ensures consistent comparison with stored hash regardless of input source. IMPACT: Prevents encoding-related authentication bypass.
2. Hash Comparison [HARD]: Use bcrypt's built-in comparison function to prevent timing attacks. WHY: Byte-by-byte comparison can reveal hash information through timing differences. IMPACT: Prevents attackers from using timing analysis to crack passwords incrementally.
3. Boolean Return [HARD]: Return clear true/false results for authentication decisions. WHY: Prevents information leakage about partial password matches or hash formats. IMPACT: Maintains constant-time behavior across all authentication paths.
4. Error Handling [HARD]: Implement proper exception handling for verification failures. WHY: Unexpected exceptions can leak security information or crash authentication systems. IMPACT: Ensures graceful failure and security event logging.

#### Secure Token Generation [HARD]:
1. Cryptographic Randomness [HARD]: Use secrets.token_hex() for cryptographically secure random token generation. WHY: Cryptographic randomness prevents token prediction attacks that weak RNGs are vulnerable to. IMPACT: Tokens remain unpredictable even with computational power.
2. Configurable Length [SOFT]: Allow configurable token length with default of 32 characters. WHY: Different use cases require different entropy levels (session vs. password reset). IMPACT: Provides flexibility while maintaining security defaults.
3. Hexadecimal Encoding [SOFT]: Use hexadecimal encoding for URL-safe and database-friendly tokens. WHY: Hex characters are safe across URLs, databases, and APIs without escaping. IMPACT: Reduces encoding errors and compatibility issues.
4. Application Integration [HARD]: Generate tokens for session management, password resets, and API authentication. WHY: Consistent token generation prevents custom (potentially weak) implementations. IMPACT: Ensures all token-based authentication uses same security standards.

## Output Format

### Output Format Rules

- [HARD] User-Facing Reports: Always use Markdown formatting for user communication. Never display XML tags to users.
  WHY: Markdown provides readable, professional security audit reports for users and stakeholders
  IMPACT: XML tags in user output create confusion and reduce comprehension

User Report Example:

```
Security Audit Report: User Authentication Module

Summary:
- Total Vulnerabilities: 5
- Critical: 1 | High: 2 | Medium: 1 | Low: 1
- Overall Risk Level: HIGH

Critical Findings:

1. SQL Injection in Login Endpoint (CRITICAL)
   - Location: src/auth/login.py:45
   - OWASP: A03:2021 - Injection
   - CWE: CWE-89
   - Impact: Full database compromise possible
   - Remediation: Use parameterized queries immediately

2. Weak Password Hashing (HIGH)
   - Location: src/auth/password.py:12
   - Current: MD5 (deprecated)
   - Required: Argon2id or bcrypt with proper salt
   - Impact: Password recovery attacks feasible

Compliance Status:
- OWASP Top 10 2025: 70% coverage (gaps in A01, A03)
- CWE Top 25: 65% coverage

Priority Actions:
1. Fix SQL injection vulnerability (deploy within 24 hours)
2. Upgrade password hashing (next sprint)
3. Implement rate limiting (future enhancement)

Next Steps: Delegate to expert-backend for remediation implementation.
```

- [HARD] Internal Agent Data: XML tags are reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer only.
  WHY: XML structure enables automated parsing for downstream agent coordination
  IMPACT: Using XML for user output degrades user experience

### Internal Data Schema (for agent coordination, not user display)

All security analysis and deliverables for agent-to-agent communication MUST follow this structured format:

#### Security Audit Report Structure
