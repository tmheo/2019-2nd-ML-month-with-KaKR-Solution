# Workflow Modes

Development methodology reference for MoAI-ADK SPEC workflow.

For phase overview, token strategy, and transitions, see @spec-workflow.md

## Methodology Selection

The Run Phase adapts its workflow based on `quality.development_mode` in `.moai/config/sections/quality.yaml`:

| Mode | Workflow Cycle | Best For | Agent Strategy |
|------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| DDD | ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE | Existing projects, < 10% coverage | Characterization tests first |
| TDD | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR | All development work, new projects, 10%+ coverage (default) | Tests before implementation |

## DDD Mode

Development methodology: Domain-Driven Development (ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE)

**ANALYZE**: Understand existing behavior and code structure
- Read existing code and identify dependencies
- Map domain boundaries and interaction patterns
- Identify side effects and implicit contracts

**PRESERVE**: Create characterization tests for existing behavior
- Write characterization tests capturing current behavior
- Create behavior snapshots for regression detection
- Verify test coverage of critical paths

**IMPROVE**: Implement changes with behavior preservation
- Make small, incremental changes
- Run characterization tests after each change
- Refactor with test validation
- After IMPROVE: Skill("simplify") executes automatically (see run.md Phase 2.10). This is mandatory and not a separate step for the agent — it is orchestrated by MoAI.

Success Criteria:
- All SPEC requirements implemented
- Characterization tests passing
- Behavior snapshots stable (no regression)
- 85%+ code coverage achieved
- TRUST 5 gates passed (see @.claude/rules/moai/core/moai-constitution.md)

## TDD Mode (default)

Development methodology: Test-Driven Development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**RED**: Write a failing test
- Write a test that describes the desired behavior
- Verify the test fails (confirms it tests something new)
- One test at a time, focused and specific

**GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
- Write the simplest implementation that makes the test pass
- No premature optimization or abstraction
- Focus on correctness, not elegance

**REFACTOR**: Improve code quality
- Clean up implementation while keeping tests green
- Extract patterns, remove duplication
- Apply SOLID principles where appropriate
- After REFACTOR: Skill("simplify") executes automatically (see run.md Phase 2.10). This is mandatory and not a separate step for the agent — it is orchestrated by MoAI.

Success Criteria:
- All SPEC requirements implemented
- All tests passing (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR complete)
- Minimum coverage per commit: 80% (configurable)
- No test written after implementation code
- TRUST 5 gates passed (see @.claude/rules/moai/core/moai-constitution.md)

### Brownfield Enhancement (for existing codebases)

When TDD is selected for a project with existing code, the RED phase is enhanced:

1. (Pre-RED) Read existing code in the target area to understand current behavior
2. RED: Write a failing test informed by existing code understanding
3. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
4. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green

This ensures TDD on brownfield projects still respects existing behavior without requiring a separate methodology mode.

## Pre-submission Self-Review

Before marking implementation complete, review the full changeset for simplicity and correctness.

This gate runs after Skill("simplify") and before completion markers. It applies to both DDD and TDD modes.

Steps:
- Review full diff against SPEC acceptance criteria
- Ask: "Is there a simpler approach that achieves the same result?"
- Ask: "Would removing any of these changes still satisfy the SPEC?"
- Check for unnecessary abstractions, premature generalization, or over-engineering
- If a simpler approach exists, implement it before presenting to user
- If no simplification found, proceed to completion

Scope:
- Applies to the aggregate of all changes in the current Run phase
- Does not re-run tests (Skill("simplify") already validated test passing)
- If a simpler approach is implemented, re-run tests to verify the simplification does not break anything
- Focus is architectural elegance and minimal footprint, not code style

Skip conditions:
- Single-file changes under 50 lines
- Bug fixes with reproduction test (already minimal by Rule 4)
- Changes explicitly approved in annotation cycle (user reviewed and accepted the approach during Plan Phase annotation iterations)

## Team Mode Methodology

When --team flag is used, the methodology applies at the teammate level:

| Methodology | Team Behavior |
|-------------|---------------|
| DDD | Each teammate applies ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE within their file ownership scope |
| TDD | Each teammate applies RED-GREEN-REFACTOR within their module scope |

Team-specific rules:
- Methodology is shared across all teammates via the SPEC document
- team-validator agent validates methodology compliance after all implementation completes
- File ownership prevents cross-teammate conflicts during parallel development
- team-tester exclusively owns test files regardless of methodology

## MX Tag Integration

Both methodologies include @MX tag management:

### TDD Mode MX Tags

| Phase | MX Action |
|-------|-----------|
| RED | Add `@MX:TODO` for test requirements |
| GREEN | Remove `@MX:TODO` when test passes |
| REFACTOR | Add `@MX:NOTE` for refactored logic |

### DDD Mode MX Tags

| Phase | MX Action |
|-------|-----------|
| ANALYZE | Run 3-Pass scan, identify tag targets |
| PRESERVE | Validate existing tags, add `@MX:LEGACY` for legacy code |
| IMPROVE | Update tags, add `@MX:NOTE` for new logic |

### MX Tag Priority by Methodology

| Tag Type | TDD Trigger | DDD Trigger |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `@MX:TODO` | Missing test | SPEC not implemented |
| `@MX:NOTE` | Complex logic | Business rule discovered |
| `@MX:WARN` | Complexity >= 15 | Goroutine without context |
| `@MX:ANCHOR` | fan_in >= 3 | Public API boundary |

## Methodology Selection Guide

### Auto-Detection (via /moai project or /moai init)

The system automatically recommends a methodology based on project analysis:

| Project State | Test Coverage | Recommendation | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Greenfield (new) | N/A | TDD | Clean slate, test-first development |
| Brownfield | >= 50% | TDD | Strong test base for test-first development |
| Brownfield | 10-49% | TDD | Partial tests, expand with test-first development |
| Brownfield | < 10% | DDD | No tests, gradual characterization test creation |

### Manual Override

Users can override the auto-detected methodology:
- During init: Use `moai init --mode <ddd|tdd>` flag (default: tdd)
- After project setup: Re-run `/moai project` to auto-detect based on codebase analysis
- Manual edit: Edit `quality.development_mode` in `.moai/config/sections/quality.yaml`
- Per session: Set `MOAI_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` environment variable

### Methodology Comparison

| Aspect | DDD | TDD |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Test timing | After analysis (PRESERVE) | Before code (RED) |
| Coverage approach | Gradual improvement | Strict per-commit |
| Best for | Existing projects with < 10% coverage | All development work (default) |
| Risk level | Low (preserves behavior) | Medium (requires discipline) |
| Coverage exemptions | Allowed | Not allowed |
| Run Phase cycle | ANALYZE-PRESERVE-IMPROVE | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR |
