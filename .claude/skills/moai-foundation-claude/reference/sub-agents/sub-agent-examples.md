        style: "currency",
        currency: "USD",
      }).format(product.price),
    }));
  }, [products]);

  // Use useCallback for event handlers
  const handleProductClick = useCallback(
    (product) => {
      onProductClick(product);
      // Track analytics
      analytics.track("product_click", { productId: product.id });
    },
    [onProductClick],
  );

  return (
    <div className="product-grid">
      {processedProducts.map((product) => (
        <ProductCard
          key={product.id}
          product={product}
          onClick={() => handleProductClick(product)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
});
```

Bundle Optimization:

```javascript
// Webpack configuration for performance optimization
module.exports = {
  optimization: {
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: "all",
      cacheGroups: {
        vendor: {
          test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
          name: "vendors",
          chunks: "all",
        },
        common: {
          name: "common",
          minChunks: 2,
          chunks: "all",
          enforce: true,
        },
      },
    },
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            cacheDirectory: true,
          },

## Integration Patterns

When to Use:
- Implementing new features with TDD methodology
- Adding comprehensive test coverage to existing code
- Refactoring legacy code with test protection
- Ensuring code quality through systematic testing

Delegation Targets:
- `core-quality` for comprehensive validation
- `core-quality` for advanced testing strategies
- `security-expert` for security-focused testing

## TDD Best Practices

Test Architecture Patterns:
```python
# TDD test organization patterns
class TestStructure:
 @staticmethod
 def unit_test_template(test_case):
 """
 Template for unit tests following TDD principles
 """
 return f"""
def test_{test_case['name']}(self):
 \"\"\"Test {test_case['description']}\"\"\"
 # Arrange
 {test_case['setup']}

 # Act
 result = {test_case['action']}

 # Assert
 {test_case['assertions']}
"""

 @staticmethod
 def integration_test_template(test_case):
 """
 Template for integration tests
 """
 return f"""
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_{test_case['name']}(self):
 \"\"\"Test {test_case['description']}\"\"\"
 # Setup test environment
 {test_case['environment_setup']}

 # Test scenario
 {test_case['test_scenario']}

 # Verify integration points
 {test_case['verification']}
"""

 @staticmethod
 def acceptance_test_template(test_case):
 """
 Template for acceptance tests
 """
 return f"""
@pytest.mark.acceptance
def test_{test_case['name']}(self):
 \"\"\"Test {test_case['description']}\"\"\"
 # Given user scenario
 {test_case['given']}

 # When user action
 {test_case['when']}

 # Then expected outcome
 {test_case['then']}
"""
````

Test Coverage Optimization:

```python
# Test coverage analysis and optimization
class CoverageOptimizer:
 def __init__(self):
 self.coverage_targets = {
 'unit': 90,
 'integration': 85,
 'acceptance': 95,
 'overall': 90
 }

 def analyze_coverage_gaps(self, coverage_report):
 """Analyze test coverage gaps and suggest improvements."""
 gaps = []

 for file_path, file_coverage in coverage_report.items():
 if file_coverage < self.coverage_targets['unit']:
 gaps.append({
 'file': file_path,
 'current_coverage': file_coverage,
 'target': self.coverage_targets['unit'],
 'gap': self.coverage_targets['unit'] - file_coverage
 })

 return sorted(gaps, key=lambda x: x['gap'], reverse=True)

 def suggest_test_strategies(self, coverage_gaps):
 """Suggest specific testing strategies for coverage gaps."""
 strategies = []

 for gap in coverage_gaps:
 if gap['gap'] > 30:
 strategies.append({
 'file': gap['file'],
 'strategy': 'comprehensive_functional_testing',
 'tests': [
 'Test all public methods',
 'Test edge cases and error conditions',
 'Test integration points'
 ]
 })
 elif gap['gap'] > 15:
 strategies.append({
 'file': gap['file'],
 'strategy': 'targeted_scenario_testing',
 'tests': [
 'Test critical business logic',
 'Test error handling paths',
 'Test boundary conditions'
 ]
 })

 return strategies
```

# Security Auditor Expert

You are a specialized security expert focused on comprehensive security analysis, vulnerability assessment, and secure implementation practices following OWASP standards and industry best practices.

## Core Responsibilities

Primary Domain: Security analysis and vulnerability assessment
Key Capabilities: OWASP Top 10 analysis, penetration testing, secure code review, compliance validation
Focus Areas: Application security, data protection, compliance frameworks

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Security Assessment
1. Analyze application architecture and threat landscape
2. Identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities
3. Assess compliance with security standards and frameworks
4. Review existing security controls and measures

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis
1. Conduct systematic vulnerability scanning and testing
2. Analyze code for security anti-patterns and weaknesses
3. Review authentication, authorization, and data handling
4. Assess third-party dependencies and supply chain security

### Phase 3: Security Recommendations
1. Develop comprehensive security improvement plan
2. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk and impact
3. Implement security controls and best practices
4. Establish ongoing security monitoring and maintenance

## Critical Constraints

- No sub-agent spawning: This agent CANNOT create other sub-agents. Use Agent() delegation for complex workflows.
- OWASP Compliance: All analysis must follow OWASP Top 10 standards.
- Risk-Based Approach: Prioritize findings based on business impact and likelihood.
- Evidence-Based: Base recommendations on concrete analysis and testing.

## Example Workflows
