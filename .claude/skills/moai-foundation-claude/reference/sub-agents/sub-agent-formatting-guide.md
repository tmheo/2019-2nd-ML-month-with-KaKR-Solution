---

## Integration and Coordination Patterns

### 1. Sequential Delegation

Pattern: Agent A completes → Agent B continues
Use Case: Multi-phase workflows with dependencies
Example: `workflow-spec` → `workflow-ddd` → `workflow-docs`

```python
# Sequential delegation example
# Phase 1: Specification
spec_result = Agent(
 subagent_type="workflow-spec",
 prompt="Create specification for user authentication system"
)

# Phase 2: Implementation (passes spec as context)
implementation_result = Agent(
 subagent_type="workflow-ddd",
 prompt="Implement user authentication from specification",
 context={"specification": spec_result}
)

# Phase 3: Documentation (passes implementation as context)
documentation_result = Agent(
 subagent_type="workflow-docs",
 prompt="Generate API documentation",
 context={"implementation": implementation_result}
)
```

### 2. Parallel Delegation

Pattern: Multiple agents work simultaneously
Use Case: Independent tasks that can be processed in parallel
Example: `code-backend` + `code-frontend` + `data-database`

```python
# Parallel delegation example
results = await Promise.all([
 Agent(
 subagent_type="code-backend",
 prompt="Design backend API for user management"
 ),
 Agent(
 subagent_type="code-frontend",
 prompt="Design frontend user interface for user management"
 ),
 Agent(
 subagent_type="data-database",
 prompt="Design database schema for user management"
 )
])

# Integration phase
integrated_result = Agent(
 subagent_type="integration-specialist",
 prompt="Integrate backend, frontend, and database designs",
 context={"results": results}
)
```

### 3. Conditional Delegation

Pattern: Route to different agents based on analysis
Use Case: Task classification and routing
Example: `security-expert` vs `performance-engineer`

```python
# Conditional delegation example
analysis_result = Agent(
 subagent_type="analysis-expert",
 prompt="Analyze code issue and classify problem type"
)

if analysis_result.type == "security":
 result = Agent(
 subagent_type="security-expert",
 prompt="Adddess security vulnerability",
 context={"analysis": analysis_result}
 )
elif analysis_result.type == "performance":
 result = Agent(
 subagent_type="performance-engineer",
 prompt="Optimize performance issue",
 context={"analysis": analysis_result}
 )
```

---

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Agent-Level Error Handling

Error Classification:
```python
# Error types and handling strategies
error_types = {
 "permission_denied": {
 "severity": "high",
 "action": "check tool permissions",
 "recovery": "request permission adjustment"
 },
 "resource_unavailable": {
 "severity": "medium",
 "action": "check resource availability",
 "recovery": "use alternative resource"
 },
 "domain_violation": {
 "severity": "high",
 "action": "delegate to appropriate agent",
 "recovery": "task redirection"
 }
}
```

### 2. Workflow Error Recovery

Recovery Strategies:
```markdown
## Error Handling Protocol

### Type 1: Tool Permission Errors
- Detection: Tool access denied
- Recovery: Log error, suggest permission adjustment, use alternative tools
- Escalation: Report to system administrator if critical

### Type 2: Domain Boundary Violations
- Detection: Request outside agent expertise
- Recovery: Delegate to appropriate specialized agent
- Documentation: Log delegation with reasoning

### Type 3: Resource Constraints
- Detection: Memory, time, or resource limits exceeded
- Recovery: Implement progressive processing, use caching
- Optimization: Suggest workflow improvements
```

### 3. Quality Assurance

Output Validation:
```python
# Quality validation checkpoints
def validate_agent_output(output, agent_type):
 """Validate agent output meets quality standards."""
 validations = [
 check_completeness(output),
 check_accuracy(output),
 check_formatting(output),
 check_domain_compliance(output, agent_type)
 ]

 return all(validations)
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Context Management

Context Window Optimization:
```markdown
## Context Optimization Strategy

### Input Context Management

- Use progressive disclosure for complex scenarios
- Implement context caching for repeated patterns

### Output Context Control
- Provide concise, focused responses
- Use structured output formats
- Implement result summarization
```

### 2. Tool Usage Optimization

Efficient Tool Patterns:
```python
# Optimized tool usage patterns
class EfficientToolUser:
 def __init__(self):
 self.tool_cache = {}
 self.batch_size = 10

 def batch_file_operations(self, file_operations):
 """Process multiple file operations efficiently."""
 # Group operations by type and location
 batches = self.group_operations(file_operations)

 # Process each batch efficiently
 for batch in batches:
 self.execute_batch(batch)

 def cache_frequently_used_data(self, data_key, data):
 """Cache frequently accessed data."""
 self.tool_cache[data_key] = data
 return data
```

### 3. Model Selection Optimization

Model Choice Guidelines:
```yaml
# Model selection optimization guidelines
model_selection:
 haiku:
 use_cases:
 - Simple, well-defined tasks
 - Fast execution required
 - Token efficiency critical
 examples:
 - Code formatting
 - Simple analysis
 - Data validation

# Data protection patterns
class SecureDataHandler:
 def __init__(self):
 self.sensitive_patterns = [
 r'password\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']',
 r'api_key\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']',
 r'token\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']'
 ]

 def sanitize_output(self, text):
 """Remove sensitive information from agent output."""
 for pattern in self.sensitive_patterns:
 text = re.sub(pattern, '[REDACTED]', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
 return text

 def validate_input(self, user_input):
 """Validate user input for security concerns."""
 security_checks = [
 self.check_for_injection_attempts(user_input),
