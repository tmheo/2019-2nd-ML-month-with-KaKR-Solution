- CI/CD pipeline integration with automated quality checks

Quick Access:

- TRUST 5 Framework: See [trust5-validation.md](modules/trust5-validation.md)
- Proactive Analysis: See [proactive-analysis.md](modules/proactive-analysis.md)
- Best Practices: See [best-practices.md](modules/best-practices.md)
- Integration Patterns: See [integration-patterns.md](modules/integration-patterns.md)

## Implementation Guide

### Getting Started

Basic Quality Validation: Initialize QualityOrchestrator with trust5_enabled, proactive_analysis, best_practices_enforcement, and context7_integration all set to True. Call analyze_codebase method with path parameter set to source directory, languages list including python, javascript, and typescript, and quality_threshold of 0.85. The method returns comprehensive quality results.

For quality gate validation with TRUST 5, create QualityGate instance and call validate_trust5 with codebase_path, test_coverage_threshold of 0.90, and complexity_threshold of 10.

Proactive Quality Analysis: Initialize ProactiveQualityScanner with context7_client and BestPracticesEngine rule_engine. Call scan_codebase with path and scan_types list including security, performance, maintainability, and testing. Generate recommendations by calling generate_recommendations with issues, priority set to high, and auto_fix enabled.

### Core Components

#### Quality Orchestration Engine

The QualityOrchestrator class provides enterprise quality orchestration with TRUST 5 framework. Initialize with QualityConfig and create instances of TRUST5Validator, ProactiveScanner, BestPracticesEngine, Context7Client, and QualityMetricsCollector.

The analyze_codebase method performs comprehensive analysis in four phases. Phase 1 runs TRUST 5 validation on the codebase with specified thresholds. Phase 2 performs proactive analysis scanning focus areas. Phase 3 checks best practices for specified languages with Context7 docs enabled. Phase 4 collects comprehensive metrics from all analysis results.

The method returns QualityResult containing trust5_validation, proactive_analysis, best_practices, metrics, and overall_score calculated from all results.

Detailed implementations available in modules:

- TRUST 5 Validator Implementation in [trust5-validation.md](modules/trust5-validation.md)
- Proactive Scanner Implementation in [proactive-analysis.md](modules/proactive-analysis.md)
- Best Practices Engine Implementation in [best-practices.md](modules/best-practices.md)

### Configuration and Customization

Quality Configuration: Create quality-config.yaml with quality_orchestration section.

Under trust5_framework, set enabled to true with thresholds for overall (0.85), testable (0.90), readable (0.80), unified (0.85), secured (0.90), and trackable (0.80).

Under proactive_analysis, set enabled true, scan_frequency to daily, and focus_areas list including performance, security, maintainability, and technical_debt.

Under auto_fix, set enabled true, severity_threshold to medium, and confirmation_required to true.

Under best_practices, set enabled true, context7_integration true, auto_update_standards true, and compliance_target to 0.85.

Under language_rules, configure python with pep8 style_guide, black formatter, ruff linter, and mypy type_checker. Configure javascript with airbnb style_guide, prettier formatter, and eslint linter. Configure typescript with google style_guide, prettier formatter, and eslint linter.

Under reporting, set enabled true, metrics_retention_days to 90, trend_analysis true, and executive_dashboard true.

Under notifications, enable quality_degradation, security_vulnerabilities, and technical_debt_increase.

Integration Examples: See [Integration Patterns](modules/integration-patterns.md) for CI/CD Pipeline Integration, GitHub Actions Integration, Quality-as-Service REST API, and Cross-Project Benchmarking.

## Advanced Patterns

### Custom Quality Rules

Create CustomQualityRule class with name, validator callable, and severity defaulting to medium. The validate async method executes the validator on codebase, wrapping in try-except. On success, return RuleResult with rule_name, passed status, severity, details, and recommendations. On exception, return RuleResult with passed false, severity error, error details, and fix recommendation.

See [Best Practices - Custom Rules](modules/best-practices.md#custom-quality-rules) for complete examples.

### Machine Learning Quality Prediction

ML-powered quality issue prediction using code feature extraction and predictive models. See [Proactive Analysis - ML Prediction](modules/proactive-analysis.md#machine-learning-quality-prediction) for implementation details.

### Real-time Quality Monitoring

Continuous quality monitoring with automated alerting for quality degradation and security vulnerabilities. See [Proactive Analysis - Real-time Monitoring](modules/proactive-analysis.md#real-time-quality-monitoring) for implementation details.

### Cross-Project Quality Benchmarking

Compare project quality metrics against similar projects in your industry. See [Integration Patterns - Benchmarking](modules/integration-patterns.md#cross-project-quality-benchmarking) for implementation details.
