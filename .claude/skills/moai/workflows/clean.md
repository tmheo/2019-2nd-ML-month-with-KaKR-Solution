# Workflow: Clean - Dead Code Removal

Purpose: Identify and safely remove unused code through static analysis, usage graph traversal, and test-verified removal. Ensures no regressions are introduced.

Flow: Static Analysis -> Usage Graph -> Classification -> Safe Removal -> Test Verification -> Report

## Supported Flags

- --dry (alias --dry-run): Preview dead code without removing anything
- --safe-only: Only remove confirmed dead code (skip uncertain cases)
- --file PATH: Target specific file or directory for analysis
- --type TYPE: Focus on specific code type (functions, imports, types, variables, files)
- --aggressive: Include code with low usage (1 caller that is also dead)

## Phase 1: Static Analysis Scan

[HARD] Delegate static analysis to the expert-refactoring subagent.

Language-specific dead code detection:

- Go: `go vet ./...` for unused variables, `staticcheck` for unused functions/types, `deadcode` tool
- Python: `vulture` for dead code detection, `autoflake` for unused imports
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `ts-prune` for unused exports, ESLint `no-unused-vars`
- Rust: `cargo clippy` for dead code warnings, `cargo udeps` for unused dependencies

If --file flag: Limit scan to the specified file/directory.
If --type flag: Filter results to the specified code type only.

Scan Categories:

- Unused imports: Import statements with no references
- Unused variables: Declared but never read
- Unused functions: Defined but never called
- Unused types: Type definitions with no usage
- Unused files: Files with no incoming imports
- Dead dependencies: Packages installed but never imported

## Phase 2: Usage Graph Analysis

[HARD] Delegate usage graph analysis to the expert-refactoring subagent.

Build a usage graph to verify static analysis results:

- For each candidate: Grep all references across the codebase
- Check indirect usage (via interfaces, reflection, dynamic dispatch)
- Check test-only usage (used only in tests, not production code)
- Check conditional compilation (#ifdef, build tags, env-based imports)
- Check external usage (exported APIs that may be used by other projects)

Classification Results:

- Confirmed Dead: No references found anywhere in codebase
- Test-Only: Used only in test files (may indicate test-specific utilities)
- Likely Dead: Low confidence (dynamic usage possible)
- False Positive: Actually used (via reflection, plugins, external consumers)

MX Tag Cross-Check (Pre-Removal Safety):

After classification, cross-check all candidates against existing @MX tags:
- @MX:ANCHOR candidates: Reclassify from "Confirmed Dead" to "False Positive" (ANCHOR indicates high fan_in; dynamic or cross-module usage is likely)
- @MX:WARN candidates: Flag for manual review even if classified as "Confirmed Dead" (warned code may have hidden dependencies)
- @MX:NOTE candidates: Include the NOTE context in the removal plan for informed user decision
- @MX:TODO candidates: If TODO indicates pending work, reclassify as "Deferred" rather than dead
- This cross-check supplements the Phase 4 safety measure: "Never remove @MX:ANCHOR without explicit approval"
- See @.claude/rules/moai/workflow/mx-tag-protocol.md for tag type definitions

If --safe-only flag: Only proceed with "Confirmed Dead" items (after MX cross-check).
If --aggressive flag: Include "Likely Dead" items for removal (MX cross-check still applies).

## Phase 3: Removal Plan

Present removal plan via AskUserQuestion (unless --dry flag):

```markdown
## Dead Code Analysis Results

### Confirmed Dead (safe to remove)
- file.go: UnusedFunction (0 references)
- file.go: unusedVariable (0 references)
- unused_file.go: Entire file (0 imports)

### Test-Only Usage
- file.go: TestHelper (used in 2 test files only)

### Likely Dead (uncertain)
- file.go: MaybeUsed (1 reference in dead code chain)

### Summary
- Total candidates: N
- Safe to remove: N
- Lines to be removed: N
```

Options:

- Remove confirmed dead code (Recommended): Remove all items classified as "Confirmed Dead". This is the safest option with minimal risk of breaking anything. Tests will verify no regressions.
- Remove confirmed + test-only: Also remove test-only utilities that are no longer needed. Choose this for a more thorough cleanup.
- Review each item: Review each dead code candidate individually before deciding. MoAI will present them one by one for your approval.
- Cancel: Do not remove any code.

If --dry flag: Display analysis results and exit without removing anything.

### Batch Mode Decision [MANDATORY EVALUATION]

After Phase 3 user approval, MoAI MUST evaluate whether to use Skill("batch") for removal.

Condition: confirmed_dead_count >= 20 items approved for removal

Decision:

- If condition is met: Execute Skill("batch") directly. Batch mode assigns each package or module to an independent agent running in a git worktree. Each agent removes its assigned dead code, runs the test suite to verify no regressions, and reports results. Agents that encounter test failures automatically roll back their specific removals and mark affected items as false positives.
- If condition is not met: Continue to standard sequential Phase 4 below.

Batch execution instructions when triggered:
1. Group confirmed dead items by package/module (minimize cross-package dependencies per batch unit)
2. Each batch agent receives: its assigned removal list, the removal order (leaf nodes first), safety measures defined in Phase 4 below
3. Each agent must run tests after removal and report pass/fail per item

## Phase 4: Safe Removal

[HARD] Delegate removal to the expert-refactoring subagent.

Removal Strategy:

1. Create removal order based on dependency graph (leaf nodes first)
2. For each removal:
   - Remove the dead code using Edit tool
   - Update any affected imports
   - Clean up empty files if all exports removed
3. After each batch of removals, run tests to verify

Safety Measures:

- Remove in reverse dependency order (callees before callers)
- Group related removals (function + its private helpers)
- Preserve @MX tags for remaining code (update if references change)
- Never remove code with @MX:ANCHOR tag without explicit approval

## Phase 5: Test Verification

[HARD] Delegate test verification to the expert-testing subagent.

After removals:
- Run full test suite: `go test -race ./...` (Go) or equivalent
- Verify no test failures
- Check that no new linting errors were introduced
- Confirm build succeeds

If tests fail:
- Identify which removal caused the failure
- Rollback that specific removal
- Mark the item as "False Positive" in the report
- Continue with remaining removals

## Phase 5.5: MX Tag Cleanup

After verified removals:
- Remove @MX tags from deleted code
- Update @MX:ANCHOR fan_in counts if callers were removed
- Demote @MX:ANCHOR to @MX:NOTE if fan_in drops below 3
- Generate MX tag change report

## Phase 6: Report

Display removal report in user's conversation_language:

```markdown
## Dead Code Removal Report

### Removed: N items (M lines)
- file.go: UnusedFunction (15 lines)
- file.go: unusedVariable (1 line)
- unused_file.go: Entire file deleted (120 lines)

### Kept (false positives): N items
- file.go: DynamicHandler (used via reflection)

### Test Results: PASS (all tests green)

### Codebase Reduction
- Files removed: N
- Lines removed: M
- Dependencies removed: K
```

Next Steps (AskUserQuestion):

- Commit changes (Recommended): Create a git commit with the dead code removal. The commit message will list all removed items for traceability.
- Run coverage analysis: Check if the removal affected test coverage. Dead test-only code removal may change coverage percentages.
- Review removed items: See the full diff of all removals for manual verification before committing.

## Task Tracking

[HARD] Task management tools mandatory:
- Each dead code candidate tracked as a pending task via TaskCreate
- Before removal: change to in_progress via TaskUpdate
- After verified removal: change to completed via TaskUpdate
- False positives marked as completed with note
