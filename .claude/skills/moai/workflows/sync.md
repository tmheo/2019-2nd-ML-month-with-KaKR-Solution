# Sync Workflow Orchestration

## Purpose

Synchronize documentation with code changes, verify project quality, and finalize pull requests. This is the third step of the Plan-Run-Sync workflow.

## Scope

- Implements Step 4 of MoAI's 4-step workflow (Report and Commit)
- Receives implementation artifacts from /moai run
- Produces synchronized documentation, commits, and PR readiness

## Input

- $ARGUMENTS: Mode and optional path
  - Mode: auto (default), force, status, project
  - Path: Optional synchronization target path (e.g., src/auth/)
  - Flag: --merge

## Supported Modes

- auto (default): Smart selective sync of changed files only. PR Ready conversion. Daily development workflow.
- force: Complete regeneration of all documentation. Error recovery and major refactoring use case.
- status: Read-only health check. Quick project health report with no changes.
- project: Project-wide documentation updates. Milestone completion and periodic sync use case.

### Project Mode Details (ENHANCED)

The `project` mode performs comprehensive project-wide synchronization:

**When to use:**
- After completing a milestone or major feature
- Before releasing a new version
- Periodic maintenance (weekly/monthly)
- After significant refactoring
- When `.moai/project/` documents are outdated

**What project mode does:**

1. **Full Project Scan** (vs. auto mode's selective scan):
   - Scans ALL source files (not just changed files)
   - Checks ALL SPEC documents for updates needed
   - Verifies ALL project documentation consistency
   - Validates ALL language files for MX tag coverage

2. **SPEC Document Update Detection**:
   - Compares implementation against SPEC requirements
   - Detects implemented features not documented in SPEC
   - Detects SPEC requirements not yet implemented
   - Flags SPEC documents requiring updates

3. **Project Document Updates**:
   - Updates `.moai/project/tech.md` when new dependencies/technologies added
   - Updates `.moai/project/structure.md` when architecture changes
   - Updates `.moai/project/product.md` when new features added
   - Updates `.moai/project/codemaps/` when architecture changes detected (delegates to codemaps workflow)
   - Updates README.md to reflect current project state

4. **Comprehensive Quality Verification**:
   - Runs full test suite (all languages)
   - Lint check for ALL source files
   - Type check for ALL source files
   - MX tag validation for ALL source files

**Output for project mode:**
- Complete project health report
- All SPEC documents requiring updates
- All project documents requiring updates
- Recommendations for improvements
- Full language breakdown of code quality metrics

## Supported Flags

- --merge: After sync, auto-merge PR and clean up branch. Worktree/branch environment is auto-detected from git context.
- --skip-mx: Skip MX tag validation and annotation during sync.

## Context Loading

Before execution, load these essential files:

- .moai/config/config.yaml (git strategy, language settings)
- .moai/config/sections/git-strategy.yaml (auto_branch, branch creation policy)
- .moai/config/sections/language.yaml (git_commit_messages setting)
- .moai/specs/ directory listing (SPEC documents for sync)
- .moai/project/ directory listing (project documents for conditional update)
- .moai/project/codemaps/ directory listing (architecture maps for conditional update)
- README.md (current project documentation)

Pre-execution commands: git status, git diff, git branch, git log, find .moai/specs.

## Phase Sequence

### Phase 0: Deployment Readiness Check

Purpose: Verify the implementation is deployment-ready before quality verification and documentation sync. Catches deployment-blocking issues early.

#### Step 0.1: Test Passage Verification

- Run full test suite for detected project language
- Verify all tests pass (zero failures required)
- If tests fail: Present failure summary and offer options via AskUserQuestion
  - Fix and retry: Delegate to expert-debug subagent
  - Continue anyway: Proceed with warning
  - Abort: Exit sync workflow

#### Step 0.2: Migration Check

- Scan for database schema changes (new models, altered tables, migration files)
- Scan for configuration format changes (new config keys, changed defaults)
- Scan for data format changes (API request/response shape changes)
- If migrations detected: Flag as deployment prerequisite and include in sync report

#### Step 0.3: Environment and Configuration Changes

- Scan for new environment variables referenced in code but not in .env.example or documentation
- Scan for new configuration files or sections added
- Scan for changed default values in existing configuration
- If changes detected: Generate environment change summary for inclusion in PR description

#### Step 0.4: Backward Compatibility Assessment

- Identify public API changes (removed endpoints, changed signatures, removed fields)
- Identify breaking changes in exported functions or types
- Identify dependency version changes that may affect consumers
- Severity classification:
  - Breaking: Must be documented and versioned (semver major bump)
  - Deprecation: Must include migration guide
  - Compatible: No action required
- If breaking changes detected: Require explicit user acknowledgment via AskUserQuestion

Output: deployment_readiness_report with test_status, migrations_needed, env_changes, breaking_changes, and overall readiness status (READY, NEEDS_ATTENTION, or BLOCKED).

If overall status is BLOCKED: Present blocking issues to user and exit unless user overrides.

### Phase 0.5: Quality Verification

Purpose: Detect project language and run language-specific diagnostics (tests, linter, type checker) in parallel, followed by code review.

#### Step 0.5.1: Language Detection

Check indicator files in priority order (first match wins):

- Python: pyproject.toml, setup.py, requirements.txt, .python-version, Pipfile
- TypeScript: tsconfig.json, package.json with typescript dependency
- JavaScript: package.json without tsconfig
- Go: go.mod, go.sum
- Rust: Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock
- Ruby: Gemfile, .ruby-version, Rakefile
- Java: pom.xml, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts
- PHP: composer.json, composer.lock
- Kotlin: build.gradle.kts with kotlin plugin
- Swift: Package.swift, .xcodeproj, .xcworkspace
- C#/.NET: .csproj, .sln, .fsproj
- C++: CMakeLists.txt, Makefile with C++ content
- Elixir: mix.exs
- R: DESCRIPTION (R package), .Rproj, renv.lock
- Flutter/Dart: pubspec.yaml
- Scala: build.sbt, build.sc
- Fallback: unknown (skip language-specific tools, proceed to code review)

#### Step 0.5.2: Execute Diagnostics in Parallel

Launch three background tasks simultaneously:

- Test Runner: Language-specific test command (pytest, npm test, go test, cargo test, etc.)
- Linter: Language-specific lint command (ruff, eslint, golangci-lint, clippy, etc.)
- Type Checker: Language-specific type check (mypy, tsc --noEmit, go vet, etc.)

Collect all results with timeouts (180s for tests, 120s for others). Handle partial failures gracefully.

#### Step 0.5.3: Handle Test Failures

If any tests fail, use AskUserQuestion:

- Continue: Proceed with sync despite failures
- Abort: Stop sync, fix tests first (exit to Phase 4 graceful exit)

#### Step 0.5.4: Deep Code Review with Auto-Fix

Agent: manager-quality subagent

Invoke regardless of project language. Execute multi-perspective code review beyond basic TRUST 5 validation:

Review Perspectives:
- Security: OWASP Top 10 compliance, injection risks, secrets exposure, dependency vulnerabilities
- Performance: Algorithmic complexity, query efficiency (N+1), memory patterns, concurrency safety
- Quality: TRUST 5 compliance, error handling completeness, naming conventions, code consistency
- UX: User flow integrity, error states, accessibility (WCAG/ARIA), breaking changes in public interfaces

Auto-Fix Behavior:
- If critical issues found: Delegate auto-fix to expert-debug or appropriate expert subagent
- Re-run review after fix to verify resolution
- Maximum 3 auto-fix iterations for critical issues before escalating to user
- Warnings and suggestions are logged in report but do not block pipeline

Output:
- Review report with findings by severity (critical, warning, suggestion)
- @MX tag compliance status (integrated with Phase 0.6)
- Auto-fix log if corrections were applied

#### LSP Quality Gates

The sync phase enforces LSP-based quality gates as configured in quality.yaml:
- Zero errors required (lsp_quality_gates.sync.max_errors: 0)
- Maximum 10 warnings allowed (lsp_quality_gates.sync.max_warnings: 10)
- Clean LSP state required (lsp_quality_gates.sync.require_clean_lsp: true)

#### Step 0.5.5: Generate Quality Report

Aggregate all results into a quality report showing status for test-runner, linter, type-checker, and code-review. Determine overall status (PASS or WARN).

### Phase 0.6: MX Tag Validation (Multi-Language)

Purpose: Ensure code has appropriate @MX annotations for AI agent context. Supports all 16 MoAI-ADK languages.

Skip if `--skip-mx` flag is provided.

#### Step 0.6.1: Language Detection for Modified Files

Detect languages present in modified files:

| Language | Indicator Files | File Patterns | Comment Prefix |
|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Go | go.mod | *.go | `//` |
| Python | pyproject.toml | *.py | `#` |
| TypeScript | tsconfig.json | *.ts, *.tsx | `//` |
| JavaScript | package.json | *.js, *.jsx | `//` |
| Rust | Cargo.toml | *.rs | `//` |
| Java | pom.xml | *.java | `//` |
| Kotlin | build.gradle.kts | *.kt | `//` |
| C# | .csproj | *.cs | `//` |
| Ruby | Gemfile | *.rb | `#` |
| PHP | composer.json | *.php | `//` |
| Elixir | mix.exs | *.ex, *.exs | `#` |
| C++ | CMakeLists.txt | *.cpp, *.h | `//` |
| Scala | build.sbt | *.scala | `//` |
| R | DESCRIPTION | *.R, *.r | `#` |
| Flutter | pubspec.yaml | *.dart | `//` |
| Swift | Package.swift | *.swift | `//` |

#### Step 0.6.2: Scan Modified Files

- Get list of files changed since last sync (git diff)
- For each modified source file, check for @MX tags
- Identify functions/code blocks that should have tags but don't

#### Step 0.6.3: Add Missing Tags (Language-Aware)

For modified files missing @MX tags, use language-specific patterns:

**Backend Languages (Go, Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, Ruby, PHP, Elixir, C++, Scala)**:
1. **fan_in >= 3**: Add `@MX:ANCHOR` for functions/methods with many callers
2. **Language-specific WARN patterns**:
   - Go: `go func`, `go ` (goroutines without context)
   - Python: `async def`, `threading` (async/threading patterns)
   - Rust: `async fn`, `unsafe ` (async/unsafe blocks)
   - Java: `new Thread`, `Executor` (thread usage)
   - Kotlin: `GlobalScope`, `runBlocking` (coroutine issues)
   - C#: `Task.Run`, `Thread.` (async/threading)
   - Ruby: `Thread.new` (thread creation)
   - PHP: `async ` (async patterns)
   - Elixir: `Task.async`, `spawn` (async/process)
   - C++: `std::thread`, `new ` (thread/memory)
   - Scala: `Future.`, `new Thread` (async/thread)
3. **magic constants**: Add `@MX:NOTE` for unexplained values
4. **missing tests**: Add `@MX:TODO` for untested public functions

**Frontend Languages (TypeScript, JavaScript)**:
1. **fan_in >= 3**: Add `@MX:ANCHOR` for functions with many callers
2. **Promise chains**: Add `@MX:WARN` for Promise.all without error handling
3. **async/await**: Add `@MX:WARN` for async functions without try/catch
4. **magic constants**: Add `@MX:NOTE` for unexplained values
5. **missing tests**: Add `@MX:TODO` for untested functions

**Data Science Languages (R, Flutter/Dart)**:
1. **fan_in >= 3**: Add `@MX:ANCHOR` for functions with many callers
2. **Language-specific WARN patterns**:
   - R: `parallel::` (parallel processing)
   - Flutter: `Isolate.`, `Future.` (async/isolate patterns)
3. **magic constants**: Add `@MX:NOTE` for unexplained values
4. **missing tests**: Add `@MX:TODO` for untested functions

**Mobile (Swift)**:
1. **fan_in >= 3**: Add `@MX:ANCHOR` for functions with many callers
2. **Swift-specific WARN**: `Task.`, `DispatchQueue` (async/concurrency)
3. **magic constants**: Add `@MX:NOTE` for unexplained values
4. **missing tests**: Add `@MX:TODO` for untested functions

#### Step 0.6.4: Generate Tag Report

Include in sync report:
- Files scanned: N (by language)
- Tags added: N (by type, by language)
- Files requiring attention (high complexity, missing documentation)

#### MX Tag Integration

When MX tags are added during sync:
- Changes are included in the same commit as documentation updates
- Tag additions are noted in the PR description
- Report summarizes tag changes by category

Status mode early exit: If mode is "status", display quality report and exit. No further phases execute.

### Phase 0.7: Coverage Analysis and Test Generation

Purpose: Measure test coverage, identify gaps, and generate missing tests to meet coverage targets before documentation sync.

#### Step 0.7.1: Coverage Measurement

Agent: expert-testing subagent

Measure current coverage using language-specific tools:
- Go: `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...` then `go tool cover -func=coverage.out`
- Python: `pytest --cov --cov-report=json`
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `vitest run --coverage` or `jest --coverage --json`
- Rust: `cargo llvm-cov --json`

Output: Overall coverage percentage, per-file coverage, per-function data.

#### Step 0.7.2: Gap Analysis

Agent: expert-testing subagent

Identify files below the coverage target (from quality.yaml test_coverage_target, default 85%).

Prioritize gaps by risk:
- P1 (Critical): Public API functions, high fan_in (>=3), functions with @MX:ANCHOR
- P2 (High): Business logic, error handling paths
- P3 (Medium): Internal utilities, helper functions
- P4 (Low): Generated code, configuration, trivial getters/setters

#### Step 0.7.3: Test Generation

Agent: expert-testing subagent

Generate missing tests for P1 and P2 gaps:
- Follow development_mode for test style (TDD: table-driven tests, DDD: characterization tests)
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Respect file naming conventions (*_test.go, *.test.ts, test_*.py)

#### Step 0.7.4: Verification

After test generation:
- Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Re-measure coverage to confirm improvement
- Compare before/after coverage percentages

Behavior:
- If coverage target met: Proceed to Phase 1
- If coverage target not met after test generation: Log remaining gaps and proceed (do not block pipeline)

#### Step 0.7.5: Coverage Report

Include in sync quality report:
- Before/after coverage percentages
- Tests generated (count and file list)
- Remaining gaps if target not fully met
- Coverage by package/module breakdown

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

#### Step 1.1: Verify Prerequisites

- .moai/ directory must exist
- .claude/ directory must exist
- Project must be inside a Git repository


#### Step 1.2: Analyze Project Status

- Analyze Git changes: git status, git diff, categorize changed files
- Read project configuration: git_strategy.mode, conversation_language, spec_git_workflow
- Determine synchronization mode from $ARGUMENTS
- Detect worktree context: Check if git directory contains worktrees/ component
- Detect branch context: Check current branch name

#### Step 1.3: Project Status Verification

Scan ALL source files (not just changed files) for:

- Broken references and inconsistencies
- Issues with precise locations
- Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

#### Step 1.4: Synchronization Plan

Agent: manager-docs subagent

Create synchronization strategy based on Git changes, mode, project verification results, and deployment readiness report from Phase 0. Output: documents to update, SPECs requiring sync, project improvements needed, estimated scope, deployment notes to include in PR.

#### Step 1.5: SPEC-Implementation Divergence Analysis

Purpose: Detect differences between the original SPEC plan and actual implementation to ensure documentation accuracy.

For each SPEC associated with the current sync:

- Step 1.5.1: Load SPEC Documents
  - Read spec.md (requirements), plan.md (implementation plan), acceptance.md (criteria)
  - Extract planned files, planned features, and planned scope

- Step 1.5.2: Analyze Actual Implementation
  - Use git diff and git log to identify all files created, modified, or deleted during the run phase
  - Categorize changes by domain (backend, frontend, tests, config, docs)

- Step 1.5.3: Compare Plan vs Reality
  - Identify files created that were NOT in the original plan.md
  - Identify features or endpoints implemented beyond original spec.md scope
  - Identify planned items that were NOT implemented (deferred or dropped)
  - Identify unplanned refactoring or dependency changes

- Step 1.5.4: Generate Divergence Report
  - Categorize divergences: scope_expansion, unplanned_additions, deferred_items, structural_changes
  - Include: new_directories_created, new_dependencies_added, new_features_implemented
  - This report feeds into Phase 2.2 (SPEC updates) and Phase 2.2.5 (project doc updates)

- Step 1.5.5: Check SPEC Lifecycle Level
  - Read SPEC metadata for lifecycle level (default: spec-first if not specified)
  - Level 1 (spec-first): SPEC will be marked completed with implementation summary appended
  - Level 2 (spec-anchored): SPEC content will be updated to reflect actual implementation
  - Level 3 (spec-as-source): Flag discrepancies as warnings (implementation should match SPEC exactly)

#### Step 1.6: User Approval

Tool: AskUserQuestion

Display sync plan report and present options:

- Proceed with Sync
- Request Modifications (re-run Phase 1)
- Review Details (show full project results, re-ask)
- Abort (exit with no changes)

### Phase 2: Execute Document Synchronization

#### Step 2.1: Create Safety Backup

Before any modifications:

- Generate timestamp identifier
- Create backup directory: .moai/backups/sync-{timestamp}/
- Copy critical files: README.md, docs/, .moai/specs/
- Verify backup integrity (non-empty directory check)

#### Step 2.2: Document Synchronization

Agent: manager-docs subagent

Input: Approved sync plan, project verification results, changed files list, divergence report from Phase 1.5.

Tasks for manager-docs:

- Reflect changed code in Living Documents
- Auto-generate and update API documentation
- Update README if needed
- Synchronize architecture documents
- Fix project issues and restore broken references
- Update SPEC documents based on divergence analysis and lifecycle level (see Step 2.2.1)
- Detect changed domains and generate domain-specific updates
- Generate sync report: .moai/reports/sync-report-{timestamp}.md

All document updates use conversation_language setting.

##### Step 2.2.1: SPEC Document Update (Based on Divergence Report)

Apply updates based on SPEC lifecycle level detected in Phase 1.5.5:

Level 1 (spec-first):
- Append "Implementation Notes" section to spec.md summarizing actual implementation
- Record scope changes: features added beyond plan, items deferred
- Mark SPEC as completed (no ongoing maintenance expected)

Level 2 (spec-anchored):
- Update spec.md requirements to reflect actual implementation
- Add new EARS-format requirements for features implemented beyond original scope
- Update plan.md with actual implementation steps taken
- Update acceptance.md with new acceptance criteria for added features
- Preserve original requirements with "as-implemented" annotations where changed

Level 3 (spec-as-source):
- Do NOT modify SPEC content
- Generate discrepancy report listing implementation deviations from SPEC
- Flag as warnings in sync report for manual review
- Recommend either updating SPEC or adjusting implementation

#### Step 2.2.5: Project Document Update (Conditional)

Purpose: Update .moai/project/ documents when significant structural changes are detected.

Condition: Execute this step ONLY when the divergence report from Phase 1.5 indicates:
- New directories were created in the project
- New dependencies or technologies were added
- New major features or capabilities were implemented
- Significant architectural changes occurred

Skip condition: If .moai/project/ directory does not exist or contains no files, skip this step entirely.

Agent: manager-docs subagent

Tasks for manager-docs:

- If new directories created: Update structure.md with new directory descriptions and purposes
- If new dependencies added: Update tech.md with new technology stack entries and rationale
- If new features implemented: Update product.md with new feature descriptions and use cases
- If architectural changes: Update structure.md with revised architecture patterns
- If architectural changes: Regenerate .moai/project/codemaps/ via codemaps workflow (workflows/codemaps.md) when significant structural changes (new directories, dependency graph changes, or module reorganization) are detected

Constraints:
- Only update sections relevant to detected changes (do not regenerate entire files)
- Preserve existing content and append or modify incrementally
- Use conversation_language setting for all updates

#### Step 2.3: Post-Sync Quality Verification

Agent: manager-quality subagent

Verify synchronization quality against TRUST 5:

- All project links complete
- Documents well-formatted
- All documents consistent
- No credentials exposed
- All SPECs properly linked

#### Step 2.4: Update SPEC Status

Update SPEC status based on lifecycle level and implementation completeness:

- Level 1 (spec-first): Set status to "completed". No further maintenance required.
- Level 2 (spec-anchored): Set status to "completed" if all requirements met, or "in-progress" if partial. Schedule next review based on quarterly maintenance policy.
- Level 3 (spec-as-source): Set status based on implementation-SPEC alignment. Flag discrepancies for resolution.

Record version changes, status transitions, and divergence summary. Include in sync report.

### Phase 3: Git Operations and Delivery

#### Step 3.0: Detect Git Workflow Strategy

Read `github.git_workflow` from `.moai/config/sections/system.yaml`. This determines how changes are delivered.

| Strategy | Branch Model | PR Behavior | Best For |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| github_flow | Feature branches off main | Auto-create PR to main | Team/OSS projects |
| main_direct | Direct commits to main | No PR created | Solo development |
| gitflow | develop/release/hotfix branches | PR to appropriate base | Enterprise projects |

Default strategy (if not configured): `github_flow`

Also read `github.spec_git_workflow` to determine SPEC branch handling:
- `feature_branch`: Each SPEC gets its own branch (recommended for github_flow/gitflow)
- `main_direct`: SPEC changes committed to current branch (only when git_workflow is main_direct)

#### Step 3.1: Commit Changes

Agent: manager-git subagent

- Stage all changed document files, reports, README, docs/
- Create single commit with descriptive message listing synchronized documents, project repairs, and SPEC updates
- Commit message language follows `language.git_commit_messages` setting
- Verify commit with git log

#### Step 3.1.1: Context Memory Generation in Git Commits

Purpose: Embed structured context within git commit operations to enable seamless session resumption across development cycles.

**Context Collection Process:**

1. **Decision Tracking**: Gather all decisions made during the sync phase
   - Documentation choices and rationale
   - SPEC update approach and divergence handling
   - Project improvement selections
   - Quality trade-offs accepted or deferred

2. **Constraint Discovery**: Record any constraints identified
   - Formatting requirements discovered
   - API documentation standards applied
   - Platform-specific considerations
   - Technology limitations encountered

3. **Gotcha Documentation**: Note issues found during documentation review
   - Outdated references in existing documentation
   - Missing API documentation sections
   - Inconsistencies between code and docs
   - Breaking changes requiring user notification

4. **Pattern Usage**: Document patterns applied during sync
   - Documentation templates used
   - Code-to-doc mapping strategies
   - Mermaid diagram patterns for architecture
   - README.md structure improvements

**Commit Format for Sync Phase:**

All sync commits MUST include structured context using this format:

```
docs(sync): [brief description of changes]

## SPEC Reference
SPEC: SPEC-XXX
Phase: SYNC
Timestamp: ISO-8601 timestamp

## Context (AI-Developer Memory)
- Decision: [documentation decision 1]
- Decision: [documentation decision 2]
- Pattern: [pattern 1 applied]
- Pattern: [pattern 2 applied]
- Constraint: [constraint discovered]
- Gotcha: [issue found and how resolved]

## Affected Areas
- Documents Updated: [count]
- SPEC Status: [completed|in-progress]
- Coverage Impact: [change or percentage]
```

**Session Boundary Tag Creation:**

After successful commit, create a session boundary tag to enable `/moai context` reconstruction:

```
git tag -a "moai/SPEC-{ID}/sync-complete" \
  -m "Sync phase completed
SPEC: SPEC-XXX
Docs updated: N files
Coverage verified: XX%
Context embedded in: [commit hash]
Next action: Feature complete or /moai plan for next SPEC"
```

Tag naming convention: `moai/SPEC-{ID}/sync-complete`

**Context Memory Integration:**

The embedded context enables:

1. **Session Resumption**: When resuming development, `/moai context` retrieves this information automatically
2. **Decision History**: Future SPECs build on documented decisions
3. **Pattern Reuse**: Similar documentation patterns are recognized and applied
4. **Cross-Session Continuity**: Context persists across individual AI sessions

**Implementation Details:**

- Commit message MUST include complete decision/pattern documentation
- Session boundary tag MUST be created after successful push
- Context metadata saved to `.moai/state/sync-context-{SPEC-ID}.json` for quick access
- Tag message MUST reference the commit hash for traceability

#### Step 3.1.5: Local CI Mirror Validation (Pre-PR Gate)

Purpose: Replicate CI checks locally before pushing and creating a PR to catch failures fast, without waiting for slow remote CI. Windows-specific tests are skipped (cannot run locally).

**Trigger condition**: Only run when a PR is about to be created (github_flow feature branch, gitflow feature/release/hotfix). Skip for `main_direct` strategy and direct pushes to main/develop.

##### Step 3.1.5.1: Discover CI Configuration

Read `.github/workflows/` to auto-detect CI jobs:
- If `ci.yml` (or any CI file) exists: parse jobs, steps, and commands
- If no CI config found: skip this phase entirely, log "No CI config detected"

Build a local execution plan mapping each CI job to its local equivalent:

| CI Job | CI Runner | Local Equivalent | Skippable |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| test (ubuntu) | ubuntu-latest | Local OS tests | No (run on current OS) |
| test (macos) | macos-latest | Local OS tests | No (identical on macOS) |
| test (windows) | windows-latest | **SKIP** | Yes — cannot run locally |
| lint | ubuntu-latest | Local golangci-lint | No |
| build (cross-compile) | ubuntu-latest | Local cross-compile | No |

##### Step 3.1.5.2: Run Local Equivalents in Parallel

**Go project** (detected via `go.mod`):

Launch all checks in parallel:

```bash
# Check 1: go vet (mirrors CI step)
go vet ./...

# Check 2: Tests with race detector (mirrors CI test job)
go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...

# Check 3: golangci-lint (mirrors CI lint job)
# Auto-detect if golangci-lint is available
which golangci-lint && golangci-lint run --timeout=5m \
  || echo "SKIP: golangci-lint not installed (run: go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.1.6)"

# Check 4: Cross-compile all CI targets (mirrors CI build job)
# Run all 5 targets in parallel — CGO_ENABLED=0 for all
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /tmp/ci-build-linux-amd64     ./cmd/moai/ &
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /tmp/ci-build-linux-arm64     ./cmd/moai/ &
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /tmp/ci-build-darwin-amd64    ./cmd/moai/ &
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /tmp/ci-build-darwin-arm64    ./cmd/moai/ &
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o /tmp/ci-build-windows-amd64.exe ./cmd/moai/ &
wait
```

**Python project** (detected via `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
pytest --tb=short
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
mypy . --ignore-missing-imports
```

**TypeScript/JavaScript project** (detected via `package.json`):

```bash
npm test -- --run
npm run lint
npm run build
```

**Other languages**: Run the standard test + lint + build commands discovered from CI config.

**Cross-platform build targets**: If CI config shows `strategy.matrix` with multiple `os` or `GOOS/GOARCH` values, replicate all cross-compile targets using the local toolchain.

##### Step 3.1.5.3: Skipped Checks Report

Always report what was skipped and why:

```
CI Mirror: Skipped checks
- test (windows-latest): Cannot run Windows tests locally — will be verified by remote CI
- lint: golangci-lint not installed — install with: go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.1.6
```

##### Step 3.1.5.4: Evaluate Results

**All checks pass**: Proceed to Step 3.2 automatically. Log "Local CI mirror: PASS".

**Any check fails**: Present failure summary via AskUserQuestion:

- Fix now — delegate to expert-debug subagent with failure details, then re-run CI mirror
- Push anyway — proceed to Step 3.2 with warning embedded in PR description
- Abort — exit sync workflow, preserve commit (allow local fix and re-run)

**golangci-lint not installed**: Treat as warning (not failure). Proceed to Step 3.2 with a note in the PR description: "Local lint check skipped: golangci-lint not installed."

##### Step 3.1.5.5: Embed Results in PR Description

Pass CI mirror results to Step 3.2 for inclusion in the PR body:

```markdown
## Local CI Mirror Results
| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| go vet | ✅ Pass | |
| go test -race (macOS) | ✅ Pass | Coverage: 87% |
| golangci-lint | ✅ Pass | |
| build linux/amd64 | ✅ Pass | |
| build linux/arm64 | ✅ Pass | |
| build darwin/amd64 | ✅ Pass | |
| build darwin/arm64 | ✅ Pass | |
| build windows/amd64 | ✅ Pass | |
| test (windows) | ⏭ Skipped | Cannot run locally |
```

#### Step 3.2: Push and Deliver (Strategy-Aware)

Behavior varies based on `github.git_workflow` setting and current branch context.

##### Strategy: github_flow

Detect current branch:

**Feature branch** (any branch other than main):
1. Push branch to remote: `git push -u origin <branch>`
2. Check if PR already exists: `gh pr list --head <branch> --json number`
3. If no PR exists: Create PR via `gh pr create`
   - Title: Derived from SPEC title or branch name
   - Body: Include sync summary, files changed, quality report, deployment readiness notes (migrations, env changes, breaking changes)
   - Base: main
   - Labels: auto-detected from changed files
4. If PR exists: Update with comment summarizing sync changes
5. Display PR URL to user

**Main branch** (direct commit):
- Push directly: `git push origin main`
- Display push confirmation
- Note: Direct main commits are permitted but feature branches are recommended

**Worktree context** (detected from git directory structure):
- Push worktree branch to remote
- Create PR if not exists (same as feature branch flow)
- Display PR URL and worktree context

##### Strategy: main_direct

All commits go directly to main, no PRs:
1. Push to main: `git push origin main`
2. Display push confirmation
3. No PR created regardless of branch name

##### Strategy: gitflow

Detect current branch type and route accordingly:

**feature/* branch** → PR to `develop`:
1. Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
2. Create or update PR targeting `develop` branch
3. Display PR URL

**release/* branch** → PR to `main`:
1. Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
2. Create or update PR targeting `main` branch
3. Display PR URL

**hotfix/* branch** → PR to `main` (and back-merge to develop):
1. Push branch: `git push -u origin <branch>`
2. Create or update PR targeting `main` branch
3. After merge: Create follow-up PR to `develop` for back-merge
4. Display PR URLs

**develop branch** → Push directly:
1. Push to develop: `git push origin develop`
2. Display push confirmation

**main branch** → Error:
- Direct commits to main are not allowed in gitflow
- Suggest creating a hotfix or release branch instead

#### Step 3.3: PR Ready Transition (Team Mode)

Only applies when a PR was created in Step 3.2:

- If Team mode enabled and PR is draft: Transition to ready via `gh pr ready`
- Assign reviewers and labels if configured
- If Team mode disabled: Do NOT automatically transition (user controls readiness)

#### Step 3.3.5: Return to Base Branch (Post-PR Cleanup)

After PR/MR creation (Step 3.2) and optional ready transition (Step 3.3), return to the base branch to leave the working directory in a clean state:

**github_flow**: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
**gitflow**: `git checkout develop && git pull origin develop` (for feature branches), `git checkout main && git pull origin main` (for release/hotfix)
**main_direct**: No branch switch needed (already on main)

This ensures the developer's working directory is on the base branch, ready for the next task. The feature branch remains on the remote for review.

Remote branch cleanup after merge is handled by the hosting platform's auto-delete setting (GitHub: "Automatically delete head branches", GitLab: "Delete source branch when merge request is accepted", Bitbucket: "Close source branch"). Local branch cleanup is left to the developer (`git branch -d <branch>`).

#### Step 3.4: Auto-Merge (When --merge flag set)

Only applies when a PR was created in Step 3.2.

Execution conditions [HARD]:
- Flag must be explicitly set: --merge
- All CI/CD checks must pass
- PR must have zero merge conflicts
- Minimum reviewer approvals obtained (if Team mode)

Auto-merge execution:
1. Check CI/CD status via `gh pr checks --watch` (wait for completion)
2. Check merge conflicts via `gh pr view --json mergeable`
3. If passing and mergeable: Execute `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
4. Checkout target branch, fetch latest
5. Verify local is synchronized with remote

Auto-merge failures:
- If CI/CD fails: Report failure, display error details, do NOT merge
- If merge conflicts: Report conflicts, provide manual resolution guidance, do NOT merge
- If approvals missing (Team mode): Report pending approvals, do NOT merge

### Phase 4: Completion and Next Steps

#### Completion Report

Display summary including:
- Git workflow strategy used (github_flow, main_direct, or gitflow)
- Sync mode and scope
- Files updated and created
- Project improvements made
- Documents updated
- Reports generated
- Backup location
- PR URL (if created) or push target (if direct push)

#### Context-Aware Next Steps

Tool: AskUserQuestion with options tailored to delivery result:

**If PR was created (github_flow feature branch, or gitflow):**
- Review PR on GitHub
- Auto-Merge PR (/moai sync --merge)
- Create Next SPEC (/moai plan)
- Start New Session (/clear)

**If direct push (main_direct, or github_flow main branch):**
- Create Next SPEC (/moai plan)
- Continue Development
- Start New Session (/clear)

**If worktree context:**
- Review PR in Browser
- Return to Main Directory
- Remove This Worktree

## Team Mode

The sync phase always uses sub-agent mode (manager-docs), even when --team is active for other phases. Documentation synchronization requires sequential consistency and a single authoritative view of project state.

For rationale and details, see team/sync.md.

---

## Graceful Exit

When user aborts at any decision point:

- No changes made to documents, Git history, or branch state
- Project remains in current state
- Display retry command: /moai sync [mode]
- Exit with code 0

---

## Completion Criteria

All of the following must be verified:

- Phase 0: Deployment readiness verified (tests, migrations, env changes, backward compatibility)
- Phase 0.5: Quality verification completed (tests, linter, type checker, deep code review with auto-fix)
- Phase 0.7: Coverage analysis completed (measurement, gap analysis, test generation, verification)
- Phase 1: Prerequisites verified, project analyzed, divergence analysis completed, sync plan approved by user
- Phase 2: Safety backup created and verified, documents synchronized, SPEC documents updated per lifecycle level, project documents updated (if applicable), quality verified, SPEC status updated
- Phase 3: Changes committed, local CI mirror validated (Step 3.1.5: vet + test-race + lint + cross-compile — Windows skipped), delivered per git_workflow strategy (PR created for github_flow/gitflow, direct push for main_direct), auto-merge executed (if flagged and PR exists)
- Phase 4: Completion report displayed with delivery result, appropriate next steps presented based on strategy and context
