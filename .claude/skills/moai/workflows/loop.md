# Workflow: Loop - Iterative Autonomous Fixing

Purpose: Iterative autonomous fixing until all issues resolved. AI scans, fixes, verifies, and repeats until completion conditions met or max iterations reached.

Flow: Check Completion -> Memory Check -> Diagnose -> Fix -> Verify -> Repeat

## Supported Flags

- --max N (alias --max-iterations): Maximum iteration count (default 100)
- --auto-fix: Enable auto-fix (default Level 1)
- --sequential (alias --seq): Sequential diagnostics instead of parallel
- --errors (alias --errors-only): Fix errors only, skip warnings
- --coverage (alias --include-coverage): Include coverage threshold (default 85%)
- --memory-check: Enable memory pressure detection
- --resume ID (alias --resume-from): Restore from snapshot

## Per-Iteration Cycle

Each iteration executes the following steps in order:

Step 1 - Completion Check:
- Check for completion marker in previous iteration response
- Marker types: `<moai>DONE</moai>`, `<moai>COMPLETE</moai>`
- If marker found: Exit loop with success

Step 2 - Memory Pressure Check (if --memory-check enabled):
- Calculate session duration from start time
- Monitor iteration time for GC pressure signs (doubling iteration time)
- If session duration exceeds 25 minutes OR iteration time doubling:
  - Save proactive checkpoint to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.moai/cache/loop-snapshots/memory-pressure.json
  - Warn user about memory pressure
  - Suggest resuming with /moai:loop --resume memory-pressure
- If memory-safe limit reached (50 iterations): Exit with checkpoint

Step 3 - Parallel Diagnostics:
- Launch four diagnostic tools simultaneously using Bash with run_in_background
- Tool 1: LSP diagnostics for detected language
- Tool 2: AST-grep scan with sgconfig.yml rules
- Tool 3: Test runner for detected language (pytest, jest, go test, cargo test)
- Tool 4: Coverage measurement (coverage.py, c8, go test -cover, cargo tarpaulin)
- Collect results using TaskOutput for each background task
- Aggregate into unified diagnostic report with metrics: error count, warning count, test pass rate, coverage percentage

If --sequential flag: Run LSP, then AST-grep, then Tests, then Coverage sequentially.

Step 4 - Completion Condition Check:
- Conditions: Zero errors AND all tests passing AND coverage meets threshold
- If all conditions met: Prompt user to add completion marker or continue
- If only coverage below target (zero errors + tests passing): Auto-route to coverage workflow (workflows/coverage.md) for intelligent gap analysis and test generation instead of blind looping. Coverage workflow identifies P1-P4 priority gaps and generates targeted tests.

Step 5 - Task Generation:
- [HARD] TaskCreate for all newly discovered issues with pending status

Step 5.5 - Pre-Fix MX Context Scan:
- Scan files with newly discovered issues for existing @MX tags
- @MX:ANCHOR functions: Pass as "do not break" constraints to fix agents
- @MX:WARN zones: Pass danger context; ensure fix does not worsen the warned condition
- @MX:NOTE context: Provide business logic understanding before modification
- @MX:TODO items: Match against current issues for resolution tracking
- Output: MX context map included in Step 6 fix agent prompts
- Skip if no @MX tags found in target files
- See @.claude/rules/moai/workflow/mx-tag-protocol.md for tag type definitions

Step 6 - Fix Execution:
- [HARD] Before each fix: TaskUpdate to change item to in_progress
- [HARD] Agent delegation mandate: ALL fix tasks MUST be delegated to specialized agents. NEVER execute fixes directly.

Agent selection by issue type:
- Type errors, logic bugs: expert-debug subagent
- Import/module issues: expert-backend or expert-frontend subagent
- Test failures: expert-testing subagent
- Security issues: expert-security subagent
- Performance issues: expert-performance subagent

Fix levels applied per --auto setting:
- Level 1 (Immediate): No approval. Import sorting, whitespace
- Level 2 (Safe): Log only. Rename variable, add type
- Level 3 (Approval): AskUserQuestion required. Logic change, API modify
- Level 4 (Manual): Not auto-fixed. Security, architecture

Step 7 - Verification:
- [HARD] After each fix: TaskUpdate to change item to completed

Step 7.5 - MX Tag Check:
- After fixes applied, scan modified files for MX tag requirements
- Add missing tags for modified functions:
  - New exported functions: Add @MX:NOTE or @MX:ANCHOR if fan_in >= 3
  - Dangerous patterns introduced: Add @MX:WARN with @MX:REASON
  - Unresolved issues: Keep @MX:TODO
- Remove resolved @MX:TODO tags for fixed issues
- Generate MX_TAG_REPORT with tags added/removed/updated
- See @.claude/rules/moai/workflow/mx-tag-protocol.md for tag rules

Step 8 - Snapshot Save:
- Save iteration snapshot to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.moai/cache/loop-snapshots/
- Increment iteration counter

Step 9 - Repeat or Exit:
- If max iterations reached: Display remaining issues and options
- Otherwise: Return to Step 1

## Completion Conditions

The loop exits when any of these conditions are met:
- Completion marker detected in response
- All conditions met: zero errors + tests passing + coverage threshold
- Max iterations reached (displays remaining issues)
- Memory pressure threshold exceeded (saves checkpoint)
- User interruption (state auto-saved)

Pre-exit clean sweep (when exiting with success):
- Before final report, run clean workflow (workflows/clean.md) scan on all modified files
- Remove dead code exposed by fixes (unused imports, orphaned functions)
- Skip if no dead code detected or if --errors flag was set

## MX Tag Integration

Each iteration includes MX tag management:

**Tag Updates During Loop:**
- Fix resolves an issue: Remove corresponding @MX:TODO
- Fix introduces new code: Add appropriate @MX tags
- Fix changes function signature: Re-evaluate @MX:ANCHOR
- Fix adds complexity: Add @MX:WARN if threshold exceeded

**Tag Types for Fixes:**
| Fix Type | MX Action |
|----------|-----------|
| Bug fix (resolved) | Remove @MX:TODO |
| New function added | Add @MX:NOTE or @MX:ANCHOR |
| Refactoring | Update @MX:NOTE, check ANCHOR |
| Security fix | Add @MX:NOTE with security context |

**MX Tag Report:**
After each iteration, include MX_TAG_REPORT section:
- Tags Added: List new tags with file:line
- Tags Removed: List resolved TODOs
- Tags Updated: List modified tags
- Attention Required: WARN tags requiring review

## Snapshot Management

Snapshot location: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.moai/cache/loop-snapshots/

Files:
- iteration-001.json, iteration-002.json, etc. (per-iteration snapshots)
- latest.json (symlink to most recent)
- memory-pressure.json (proactive checkpoint on memory pressure)

Loop state file: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.moai/cache/.moai_loop_state.json

Resume commands:
- /moai:loop --resume latest
- /moai:loop --resume iteration-002
- /moai:loop --resume memory-pressure

## Language-Specific Commands

Test runner and coverage tool selection is based on auto-detected project language:

| Language | Indicator File | Test Command | Coverage Command |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Go | go.mod | `go test ./...` | `go test -cover ./...` |
| Python | pyproject.toml / setup.py | `pytest --tb=short` | `coverage run -m pytest` |
| TypeScript/JavaScript | package.json | `npm test` or `jest` | `npm run coverage` or `c8` |
| Rust | Cargo.toml | `cargo test` | `cargo tarpaulin` |
| Java (Maven) | pom.xml | `mvn test -q` | `mvn jacoco:report` |
| Java (Gradle) | build.gradle | `gradle test -q` | `gradle jacocoTestReport` |
| Kotlin | build.gradle.kts | `gradle test -q` | `gradle jacocoTestReport` |
| C# | *.csproj | `dotnet test` | `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` |
| Ruby | Gemfile | `bundle exec rspec` or `bundle exec rake test` | `simplecov` (via .simplecov config) |
| PHP | composer.json | `vendor/bin/phpunit` | `vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-text` |
| Scala | build.sbt | `sbt test` | `sbt coverage test coverageReport` |
| Elixir | mix.exs | `mix test` | `mix test --cover` |
| Swift | Package.swift | `swift test` | `swift test --enable-code-coverage` |
| Flutter/Dart | pubspec.yaml | `flutter test` or `dart test` | `flutter test --coverage` |
| R | DESCRIPTION | `Rscript -e 'testthat::test_package(".")'` | `covr::package_coverage()` |
| C++ | CMakeLists.txt | `ctest --test-dir build` | `gcov`/`lcov` (if configured) |

Language detection priority: Check for indicator files in project root. If multiple present, prefer the one with the most associated source files. If detection fails, prompt user to specify language.

## Cancellation

Send any message to interrupt the loop. State is automatically saved via session_end hook.

## Safe Development Protocol

All fixes within the loop follow CLAUDE.md Section 7 Safe Development Protocol:
- Reproduction-first: Write failing tests before fixing bugs
- Post-fix review: List potential side effects after each fix cycle
- Maximum 3 retries per individual operation (per CLAUDE.md constitution)

## Execution Summary

1. Parse arguments (extract flags: --max, --auto-fix, --sequential, --errors, --coverage, --memory-check, --resume)
2. If --resume: Load state from specified snapshot and continue
3. Detect project language from indicator files
4. Initialize iteration counter and memory tracking (start time)
5. Loop: Execute per-iteration cycle (Steps 1-9, including Step 5.5 MX Context Scan)
6. On exit: Report final summary with evidence
7. If memory checkpoint created: Display resume instructions
