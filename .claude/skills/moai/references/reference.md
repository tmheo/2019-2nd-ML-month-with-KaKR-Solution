## Execution Patterns

### Parallel Execution Pattern

When multiple operations are independent, invoke them in a single response. Claude Code automatically runs multiple Agent() calls in parallel (up to 10 concurrent).

Use Cases:

- Exploration Phase: Launch codebase analysis, documentation research, and quality assessment simultaneously via separate Agent() calls
- Diagnostic Scan: Run LSP diagnostics, AST-grep analysis, and linter checks in parallel
- Multi-file Generation: Generate product.md, structure.md, and tech.md simultaneously when analysis is complete

Implementation:

- Include multiple Agent() calls in the same response message
- Each Agent() targets a different subagent or a different scope within the same agent
- Results are collected when all parallel tasks complete
- Maximum 10 concurrent Agent() calls for optimal throughput

### Sequential Execution Pattern

When operations have dependencies, chain them sequentially. Each Agent() call receives context from the previous phase results.

Use Cases:

- DDD/TDD Workflow: Phase 1 (planning) feeds Phase 2 (implementation) feeds Phase 2.5 (quality validation)
- SPEC Creation: Explore agent results feed into manager-spec agent for document generation
- Release Pipeline: Quality gates must pass before version selection, which must complete before tagging

### Hybrid Execution Pattern

Combine parallel and sequential patterns within a single workflow.

Use Cases:

- Fix Workflow: Parallel diagnostic scan (LSP + linters + AST-grep), then sequential fix application based on combined results
- MoAI Workflow: Parallel exploration phase, then sequential SPEC generation and DDD/TDD implementation

### Team Execution Pattern

When team mode is enabled, use Agent Teams for persistent parallel coordination.

Use Cases:

- Plan Phase: Parallel research team (researcher + analyst + architect)
- Run Phase: Parallel implementation team (backend-dev + frontend-dev + tester) with file ownership boundaries
- Debug Phase: Competing hypothesis investigation team

Implementation:

- TeamCreate to initialize team structure with shared task list
- Agent() with team_name and name parameters to spawn teammates
- SendMessage for inter-teammate coordination and idle handling
- TaskList for self-coordinated work distribution
- TeamDelete after all teammates shut down

---

## Resume Pattern

When a workflow is interrupted or needs to continue from a previous session, use the --resume flag.

Behavior:

- Read existing SPEC document from .moai/specs/SPEC-XXX/
- Determine last completed phase from SPEC status markers
- Skip completed phases and resume from the next pending phase
- Preserve all prior analysis, decisions, and generated artifacts

Applicable Workflows:

- plan --resume SPEC-XXX: Resume SPEC creation from last checkpoint
- run --resume SPEC-XXX: Resume DDD/TDD implementation from last completed task
- moai --resume SPEC-XXX: Resume full autonomous workflow from last phase
- fix --resume: Resume fix cycle from last diagnostic state

---

## Context Propagation Between Phases

Each phase must pass results forward to the next phase to avoid redundant analysis.

Required Context Elements:

- Exploration Results: File paths, architecture patterns, technology stack, dependency map
- SPEC Data: Requirements list, acceptance criteria, technical approach, scope boundaries
- Implementation Results: Files modified, tests created, coverage metrics, remaining tasks
- Quality Results: Test pass/fail counts, lint errors, type check results, security findings
- Implementation Divergence: Planned vs actual files, additional features, scope changes, new dependencies
- Git State: Current branch, commit count since last tag, tag history

Propagation Method:

- Include a structured summary of previous phase outputs in the Agent() prompt
- Reference specific file paths rather than inline large content blocks
- Use SPEC document as the canonical source of truth across phases
- Pass implementation divergence report from run phase to sync phase for SPEC/project document updates

## Flag Reference

### Global Flags (Available Across All Workflows)

- --resume [ID]: Resume workflow from last checkpoint (SPEC-ID or snapshot ID)
- --seq: Force sequential execution instead of parallel where applicable
- --ultrathink: Activate Sequential Thinking MCP for deep analysis before execution
- --team: Force Agent Teams mode for parallel execution
- --solo: Force sub-agent mode (single agent per phase)

### Plan Flags

- --worktree: Create an isolated git worktree for the SPEC implementation
- --branch: Create a feature branch for the SPEC (default branch naming: feature/SPEC-XXX)
- --resume SPEC-XXX: Resume an interrupted plan session
- --team: Force team-based exploration (researcher + analyst + architect)

### Run Flags

- --resume SPEC-XXX: Resume DDD/TDD implementation from last completed task
- --team: Force team-based implementation (backend-dev + frontend-dev + tester)
- --review: Enable post-implementation review loop

### Sync Flags

- Modes (positional): auto (default), force, status, project
- --merge: Auto-merge PR and clean up branch after sync
- --skip-mx: Skip MX tag validation during sync

### Fix Flags

- --dry: Preview detected issues without applying fixes
- --level N: Control fix depth (Level 1: auto-fixable, Level 2: simple logic, Level 3: complex, Level 4: architectural)
- --security: Include security issues in scan
- --sequential: Run diagnostics sequentially instead of in parallel
- --resume: Resume fix cycle from last diagnostic state
- --team: Force competing hypothesis investigation team

### Loop Flags

- --max N: Maximum iteration count (default: 100)
- --auto-fix: Enable automatic fix application for Level 1-2 issues

- --url URL: Target URL for testing
- --journey NAME: Specific user journey to test

### Clean Flags

- --dry: Preview dead code without removing
- --safe-only: Only remove confirmed dead code

### MoAI (Default) Flags

- --loop: Enable iterative fixing during run phase
- --max N: Maximum fix iterations when --loop is active
- --branch: Create feature branch before implementation
- --pr: Create pull request after completion

## Legacy Command Mapping

Previous /moai:X-Y command format mapped to new /moai subcommand format:

- /moai:0-project maps to /moai project
- /moai:1-plan maps to /moai plan
- /moai:2-run maps to /moai run
- /moai:3-sync maps to /moai sync
- /moai:9-feedback maps to /moai feedback
- /moai:fix maps to /moai fix
- /moai:loop maps to /moai loop
- /moai:moai maps to /moai (default autonomous workflow)
- /moai:review maps to /moai review
- /moai:clean maps to /moai clean
- /moai:codemaps maps to /moai codemaps
- /moai:coverage maps to /moai coverage
- /moai:e2e maps to /moai e2e
- /moai:mx maps to /moai mx

Note: /moai:99-release is a separate local-only command, not part of the /moai skill.
